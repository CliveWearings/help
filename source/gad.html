</br><p><p>It&rsquo;s come to my attention that there&rsquo;s a lot of gadgets to keep track of in this work. The following is a guide to the objects used by the characters to complete their goals.</p>
</br><p><strong>PAIN RADAR (AKA PAIN FINDER THING):</strong> The pain radar is a GPS-like box that displays the amount of discomfort being felt in a particular area. It can cover the earth, but that&rsquo;s its limit. Even for 2070, The technology of the pain radar is astronomically far off from anything modern humans have invented.</p>
<p>Note: The pain radar brought up the question to me of where physically the programs get tortured. Are the chemical reactions causing their sensations located physically inside the computers, or do they exist in a pocket universe? If they exist in a pocket universe, how does the pain radar sense them? The truth is that idk lol, it&rsquo;s either a plot hole or something something hypothetical technology. I get more confused the longer I think about it.</p>
</br><p><strong>THE ADAPTER:</strong> The adapter is a device with three chords (one green, two blue) extending out of it. If the green chord is placed on a machine, and the blues are placed on two different machines, the blues will able to view and navigate through the happenings of the green computer (like you would on a monitor) via a meta-physical train car window. Both people/machines hooked up to the blue chords, however, must be touching the glass of the train car window to view. Why? Because of a plot point that will be wrapped up in the fourth and final season.</p>
<p>Note: I know it might be a little confusing to have both a magic computer thing that takes the shape of a train car when the characters also use real train cars as their main method of transportation. I would like to clarify that the train car in the adapter has no relation to the trains they get around in.</p>
</br><p><strong>MEMORY PEN:</strong> Barton&rsquo;s memory pen can erase memories for anyone who has a pre-installed memory plate. The amount of memories erased vary on what the pen has been told to do. For example, if the pen was told to erase five minutes of a person&rsquo;s memory, it would do just that and erase every memory that person had formed in the last five minutes, with the person feeling like no time had passed at all. This technology sounds dangerous, but I believe that it could theoretically be done safely.</p>
</br><p><strong>TALA&rsquo;S LAPTOP: </strong>Although her laptop isn&rsquo;t powerful enough to play as a monitor to the massive computers they need to observe, it can be used to edit the code of programs on other computers through the power of Ethernet cables and unexplained future technology.</p>
</br><p><strong>TEX&rsquo;S GUN:</strong> Tex&rsquo;s gun is a gun. I can&rsquo;t remember what gun I decided he had, and I haven&rsquo;t been able to find one that matches the exact specifications. This is what I can say about the gun, however.</p>
<ol>
<font color="white"><li>built in silencer</li>
<li>7+1 (double stack is probably illegal in Washington in the future so he&rsquo;s getting 7)</li>
<li>semi-auto, double action only</li>
<li>capable of folding into a dice box</li>
<li>thicc bullets</li>
</ol>
</br><p><strong>TEX&rsquo;S LOCKPICK:</strong> Tex has a tiny box that rolls under doors and extends an arm to unlock the door from the inside, meaning it wouldn&rsquo;t work on doors that don&rsquo;t have a crack or way of opening from the inside.</p>

</br><p><strong> LOFGREN&rsquo;S MACHINE:</strong> The technology of Dr. Lofgren&rsquo;s machine is intentionally a mystery, as it&rsquo;s far advanced from anything I&rsquo;ve ever seen. But this is what I do know.

<p>The machine is given a starting time to begin a simulation. If the starting time is in the past, the machine creates the reality from data it had of that time period. If the starting time is the present, the machine creates an approximate copy of the world at that current moment (how it does it, I don&rsquo;t know, it would probably have to sense the position of a lot of subatomic particles, but it&rsquo;s the future lol). Then, the machine simulates from that moment on what&rsquo;s most probable to happen. If you understand quantum randomness (hopefully it was explained well enough in Gunmas), you should understand why it can&rsquo;t actually predict the future. I guess you could use it to make short trades with high accuracy, but its predictions would get more and more screwed the farther forward they were. It&rsquo;s also not ever stated in the book, but I&rsquo;ve decided to make it canon that the simulations created by the machine are slightly less complex than real life.</p>
<p>In short, the machine is better suited to hypotheticals and philosophical conundrums.</p>
<p>PS&mdash;I can clarify that the people in Dr. Lofgren&rsquo;s machine aren&rsquo;t sentient. I did get confused trying to think about the logistics of how they couldn&rsquo;t be sentient but could act exactly like humans. For a while, I decided that I would justify it by claiming that the simulations were composed of no assets and were just a single big simulation with no defined lines between the people inside it, but then I brought up the question to myself of if you could make the argument that there&rsquo;s no defined lines between the people in our universe. At this point I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m talking about, and I&rsquo;m very confused.</p>
<p>In conclusion, they are not sentient (whatever that means) because I said so.</p>
<p>PPS&mdash;I told my friend the area 51 joke I wrote about this machine and he told me there&rsquo;s a conspiracy theory about a machine in area 51 called &ldquo;Project Looking Glass&rdquo; that works in a similar way to the machine I invented.</p>
</br><p><strong>ROFFE:</strong> Roffe is Dr. Lofgren&rsquo;s dog who (as of season one) has the combined mind of a dog and a basic computing machine. He is a completely separate entity from Dr. Lofgren&rsquo;s machine.</p>
</br><p><strong>Q&amp;A:</strong> Some people have been asking me if I believe someone could create a &ldquo;living&rdquo; thing inside of computer, let alone torture it. Although it&rsquo;s kind of a theme spoiler, the answer to this is yes and kind of.</p>
<p>I do believe that humans are computers, in that I believe they&rsquo;re machines built of matter that preform computations and are restrained by the logic of physics, and I also believe we could create another living (whatever &ldquo;living&rdquo; means, I don&rsquo;t believe that life is an on and off switch) even just inside a simulation. I also believe that you could torture one of these creations, and that some people would if they had the ability. BUT I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s possible to torture something for eternity, because even without the heat death of the universe, there&rsquo;s still the issue with time perception (if you&rsquo;ve been alive for like a billion years, one year probably feels like a day), as well as the fact that people will get used to the worst sensation after a while. Which I think is good.</p>
