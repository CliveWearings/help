<p><b>PART ONE: HOW DID WE GET HERE</b>?</p>

<p>In ~1990 BC, the obelisk of the Temple of Ra-Atum was erected in Heliopolis, Egypt (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heliopolis_(ancient_Egypt)" rel="nofollow">x</a>).  Atum, the father, was the personification of the setting sun, while the falcon, Ra, was the morning (<a href="https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/atum/" rel="nofollow">x</a>). Every evening, Atum would be swallowed by the sky goddess Nut and would travel through her body to be reborn in the morning as Ra ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atum" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

</p>

<p>Atum was understood to be both the creator and destroyer of the physical world (<a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/954569113055936534/994649364242911232/unknown.png" rel="nofollow">x</a>). He is identified as “the point of life from which all emanates from,” figuratively and literally (<a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/954569113055936534/994649196189716500/unknown.png?width=466&amp;height=396" rel="nofollow">x</a> <em>also all these text images about Atum are from page 99 of </em><a href="https://archive.org/details/TheCompleteGodsAndGoddessesOfAncientEgypt/Encyclopedia%20of%20Ancient%20Egypt/" rel="nofollow"><em>The Complete Gods And Goddesses Of Ancient Egypt</em></a><em>).</em> </p>

</p>

<p>Although Atum was represented as the sun, the most concentrated point of light, everything in existence was thought to be of the flesh of Atum (<a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/954569113055936534/994649196189716500/unknown.png?width=466&amp;height=396" rel="nofollow">x</a> ). Certain people, however, were thought to be closer to his genetic lineage than others. The pharaoh was understood to be the biological son of Horus, the grandchild of Atum ( <a href="https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/954569113055936534/994649702282821814/unknown.png?width=465&amp;height=396" rel="nofollow">x</a>), while the “lower rungs of Egyptian society” were understood by Egyptian nobility to be more distantly related.</p>

<p>The trinity of Atum, Nut, and Ra was echoed through the later dynasties of Egypt as the trinity of Osiris, Isis, and Horus. I am going to gloss over this part, however, as I think I’ve unpromptedly blabbed about it enough over the past three weeks.</p>

<p>In this story that exists to describe the daily cycle of the sun, Osiris is dismembered by his jealous brother Seth who wants the throne. Seth seizes the throne, creating a period of darkness and chaos. But the goddess Isis reessembles Osiris and impregnates herself on his corpse in a feat that I suppose you could call immaculate conception (<a href="https://youtu.be/3EOnSZX5FlM?t=526" rel="nofollow"> vid </a>). Isis then gives birth to Horus, who follows his fate of returning to the holy land, overthrowing his uncle, and light and order are restored once again look honestly guys just watch the Lion King.</p>

<p>Around 100 AD, Plutarch, the Greek neo-Platonist argued that the ancient worshiped Isis, Osiris, and Horus as parts of a perfect 3-4-5 right triangle (<a href="https://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th136.htm" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008524841034457118/unknown.png" />(<a href="https://ba278b9d8106536501a2-57da1f3fe93ccf3a9828e6ce67c3d52c.ssl.cf5.rackcdn.com/ws_05_francini.pdf" rel="nofollow">x</a>)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Although I cannot verify Plutarch’s claim, the Egyptians certainly knew how to make a right triangle, the name Pyt<b>h</b> ag <b>oras</b> contains the letters in order that spell <b>Horas</b> (and <b>h</b> yp <b>o</b> ten <b>us</b> e contains <b>hou s</b>), and we all know that Pythagoras worshiped the sun.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/954569113055936534/1015687577547841636/unknown.png" /> Pythagoras and his boys worshiping the sunrise (<a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/fyodor-bronnikov/pythagoreans-celebrate-sunrise-1869" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p>The important thing to understand about this trinity is that the father (Osiris-Atum) and the son (Horus-Ra) were functionally identical, just as the sun today is functionally identical to the sun tomorrow. The son is an echo of the father who will grow up to follow exactly in his footsteps as just one more link in a mobius strip of the rising and setting sun.</p>

<p>The religion of the Egyptian royals was centered around funerary traditions (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Texts" rel="nofollow">x</a>). In life, the pharaoh would dress as Osiris with a serpent head-piece shaped like the top of a sarcophagus in an attempt to synchronize himself to Osiris (or a different god, depending on the time period, location, and gender of the deceased). </p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008879502291636224/unknown.png" />
</p>

<p>Upon death, the pharaoh would be placed in a box that resembled Osiris and the Egyptian priests would perform rituals in an attempt to help the pharaoh’s soul physically ascend (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramid_Texts" rel="nofollow">x</a>) and rise to become part of the son-sun. The biological son of the pharaoh was then understood to be the Pharaoh himself, and the cycle was complete.  </p>

<p>The further back we look in history, the more muddled kings become with gods. One historian may identify a carving as Sargon II (<a href="https://pixels.com/featured/assyrian-statue-of-king-sargon-ii-at-khorsabad-713-706-bc-louvre-museum-paris-paul-e-williams.html" rel="nofollow">x</a> ) while another sees the legendary hero Gilgamesh ( <a href="https://allmesopotamia.wordpress.com/2012/06/05/part-iv-gilgamesh/" rel="nofollow">x</a> ). And this is by design, I believe, and I see no reason why the gods worshiped by royalty would not just be an accumulated snowball of the traits and stories of hundreds of members of said royalties, aligned to one great personified deification and left to be immortalized. I would also like to place emphasis on just how elitist this religion was. The religion of the pharaohs was mystical and occult, and the hieroglyphics used in the sacred ceremonies of the elite were only allowed to be read by nobility by the hierophant ( <a href="https://youtu.be/3EOnSZX5FlM?t=761" rel="nofollow"> vid </a> , <a href="https://www.ancient-egypt-online.com/ancient-egyptian-hieroglyphics.html" rel="nofollow">x</a> ). The Egyptian pharaohs were literally carved into stone, in projects <b>which I do not think reflected the will of the majority but rather an elite minority.</b></p>

<p>Egyptian mysticism was imported into Greek culture by Pythagorus and other sages. Pythagorus was a student of Egyptian mysticism and many Greek hero cults (the cult of Mithras, the Eleusinian Mysteries) show strong parallels with the cult of Pythagorus, primarily the cult of Orpheus. The neo-Platonist Proclus once wrote</p>

<p><em> “...all that Orpheus transmitted through secret discourses connected to the mysteries, Pythagoras learnt thoroughly when he completed the initiation at Libethra in Thrace, and Aglaophamus, the initiator, revealed to him the wisdom about the gods that Orpheus acquired from his mother Calliope ( </em> <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_(religion)#cite_note-17" rel="nofollow"> <em>x</em> </a> <em> ).” </em></p>

<p>The cult of Orpheus was established well before the birth of Jesus and centered around a trinity of a father, mother, and rising son-sun. In the story central to their cult, Zeus seduces Persephone. Persephone gives birth to Dionysus, but Hera, angered at Zeus’ affair, sends a stampede of titans to trample the baby Dionysus (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orphism_(religion)" rel="nofollow">x</a>). Just as Osiris was dismembered by his brother Seth, Dionysus is dismembered by the titans. Zeus smites the entire stampede with a lightning bolt, creating a mixture of titanian substance and Dionysian substance. Dionysus’ heart is left unharmed, and Zeus puts it in his thigh, allowing Dionysus to become “part of the father”. Zeus then forms the first humans with the substance. According to the cult of Orpheus, humans contain a Dionysian spark and through the knowledge and initiations of the cult, they too can be reborn in the next life with the gods (Zeus).</p>

The earliest depiction of “two fingers up” I’ve found is from the gauntlet of Dionysus, used in Orphic cult ceremonies (below).</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Dionysus was often said by the Orphics to be born on December 25th (<a href="https://stellarhousepublishing.com/dionysus/" rel="nofollow">x</a> and I recommend this link for a full comparison of Diony<u>sus</u> to the Catholic portrayal of Je<u>sus</u>), a day which Jesus was NOT born on ( <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=when+was+jesus%27s+actual+birthday&amp;rlz=1CAIGZW_enUS1016&amp;sxsrf=ALiCzsZKjZJZmOlrlUkmZMI__bW6vli-9g%3A1660878375409&amp;ei=J_7-Yr-8F4KF0PEPvd2L6Ag&amp;oq=when+was+jesus%27s+&amp;gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EAEYADIFCAAQgAQyBQgAEIAEMgYIABAeEBYyBggAEB4QFjIGCAAQHhAWMgYIABAeEBYyBggAEB4QFjIGCAAQHhAWMgYIABAeEBYyBggAEB4QFjoHCAAQRxCwAzoHCAAQsAMQQzoECCMQJzoECAAQQzoFCAAQkQJKBAhBGABKBAhGGABQpAVYgwlg4xZoAXABeACAAXCIAeUDkgEDMi4zmAEAoAEByAEKwAEB&amp;sclient=gws-wiz" rel="nofollow">x</a> ). Some scholars will claim that Orphism simply copied Christianity but Christmas is three days after the shortest day of the year, making it the ideal day to worship the birth of the sun and many sun gods have been worshiped on or near this day before the birth of Jesus ( <a href="https://gsgriffin.com/2016/12/08/other-gods-born-to-virgins-on-december-25-before-jesus-christ/" rel="nofollow">x</a> ). The bible also never says that Jesus died on a cross, and the earliest depiction I’ve seen of the standard crucifixion (sans graffiti) is not of Jesus but of Orpheus-Dionysus ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crucifixion_in_the_arts#:~:text=The%20Alexamenos%20graffito%2C%20currently%20in,of%20the%20crucifixion%20of%20Jesus." rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

It was common for Greek scholars familiar with both the Orphic mysteries and their older Egyptian counterparts to identify Dionysis as Osiris (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dionysus#Osiris" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p>In the Hellenistic era (pre Christ), a figure known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermes_Trismegistus" rel="nofollow"> Hermes Trismegistus </a> arose within the collective subconscious of the occult.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1015690466949333124/unknown.png" /> Hermes Trismegistus immortalized on the floor of the Siena Cathedral in 1480 (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Hermes_mercurius_trismegistus_siena_cathedral.jpg" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p>Hermes Trismegistus was a mystical teacher of Egyptian occultism and advocate for the deification of man. Hermes also was associated with the trinity and was known as Thrice Great Hermes. The 10th century Sudas claimed <em> “He was called Trismegistus on account of his praise of the trinity, saying there is one divine nature in the trinity. </em> ” ( <a href="https://slife.org/hermes-trismegistus/" rel="nofollow">x</a>)</p>

<p>Hermes himself has god status, and has been synchronized to the gods Thoth (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hermes-Trismegistos-Egyptian-god" rel="nofollow">x</a> ) and Hermes. In truth, Hermes was not a real person and likely “an accumulated snowball of the traits and stories dozens of cult leaders aligned to one great personified deification and left to be immortalized” ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oYiSyahGYDc&amp;ab_channel=ManlyHallSociety" rel="nofollow">x</a>). One such man caught in this snowball was Pythagoras.</p>

<p>Even though Rome fell, texts attributed to Hermes Trismegistus were once again deciphered and rediscovered during the Renaissance Era. </p>

<p>Hermes is a figure of great interest to the Freemasons, who credit him as one of their founding philosophers along with Pythagoras (<a href="https://www.freemasonrytoday.com/features/pythagoras-the-initiate" rel="nofollow">x</a>). </p>

<p> </p>

  <b>PART 2: ADVANCED WORD SEARCHES</b>
</p>

<p>Part two begins with two men of the Renaissance era, most likely colleagues, connected by Queen Elizabeth I, the Catholic trinity, the Freemasons, and esoteric encryption related to the Shakespeare authorship question. Both of these men are also of interest to the Freemasons, the group I have dedicated my life to studying because they like to Go Hard. The Freemasons are a fraternal order of occultists who express great interest in building (hence, masons), geometry, and the secrets of the divine. There are many groups who fit this description, but the Freemasons have a particularly large amount of overlap with fraternal orders of the Catholic Church.</p>

<p>The first of these men, John Dee, is possibly one of the most influential people of the last thousand years.</p>

<p>Dee was the advisor and court astronomer of Queen Elizabeth in the time of the formation of the British empire (<a href="https://www.thoughtco.com/john-dee-biography-4158012" rel="nofollow">x</a> ), and possibly a spy, as indicated by her description of him as “My noble intelligencer, most faithful.” and “My ubiquitous eyes.” ( <a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=xEPzztkaC3kC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;lpg=PA70&amp;dq=%E2%80%9CMy+noble+intelligencer,+most+faithful.%E2%80%9D&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=i_oJD5ng90&amp;sig=ACfU3U3chuzrDxiIemNh04svQAj0uV4NwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwiMk4-YlsD5AhUPADQIHepbCRAQ6AF6BAgCEAM#v=onepage&amp;q=%E2%80%9CMy%20noble%20intelligencer%2C%20most%20faithful.%E2%80%9D&amp;f=false" rel="nofollow">x</a>)</p>

<p>Additionally, Dee was a Hermetic, a neo-Pythagorean (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee#Thought" rel="nofollow">x</a> ), an alchemist, mathematician, occultist, and attendee and fellow of Tri nity college ( <a href="https://www.britannica.com/biography/John-Dee" rel="nofollow">x</a> ). As an advisor to the queen, I believe it’s fair to call him the Renaissance equivalent of a Pharaoh (or more accurately, a hierophant). Like so many occultists, he held the belief that man had the potential for divine power that could be exercised through mathematics ( <a href="http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/staff/saj/texts/mathematicus.htm" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p>Dee was deeply fascinated with systems of symbols, be they numbers or alphabets. In his book Monas Hieroglyphica, Dee spends much time examining the shapes of characters.</p>

<p>Dee was also a primary supporter for the formation of the British Empire and has been credited for coining the phrases <em> New World </em> and <em> British Empire </em> ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee#CITEREFWilliams1985" rel="nofollow">x</a> ). Dee was not only a Catholic sympathizer but was also an advocate for reversing the protestant reforms of Martin Luther and reuniting the Lutheran church to the Catholic church ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Dee#cite_note-FOOTNOTENeal1999151%E2%80%93178-62" rel="nofollow">x</a>). The following is a quote from Dee in Monas Hieroglyphica that I believe summarizes the theme of this essay, as well as his obsession with letters and numbers. </p>

<p><em> “May we be led upwards by degrees, so informing our rude imaginations towards the conceiving of numbers absolutely that at length we may be able to find the number of our own name gloriously exemplified and registered in the book of the </em> <em> Trinitie </em> <em> most blessed an eternal.” </em>–John Dee.</p>

<p>“Finding the number of a name” refers to the practice of gematria, or finding the numerical value of words or phrases. The practice of gematria can be traced back to the Hebrew alphabet, every letter of which had a numerical value well before the invention of the 0-9 Hindu-Aribic counting system (x) around 1-6th century AD (<a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hindu-Arabic-numerals" rel="nofollow">x</a>). The Greeks and Romans also showed a fascination with “numbers of a name”.</p>

<p>An example of this is the name Jesus, which adds to 888 in Greek (<a href="https://bible-menorah.jimdofree.com/english/888/" rel="nofollow">x</a> ) and 444 in English gematria ( <a href="https://www.gematrix.org/?word=jesus" rel="nofollow">x</a> , also here’s <a href="https://www.biblestudy.org/bibleref/meaning-of-numbers-in-bible/444.html" rel="nofollow"> another link </a> furthing linking Jesus to 444). 444 is a trinity of threes, and 4 and 3 are also both associated with Jesus: 4 points on the cross, and Jesus is part of the trinity. 4 + 3 is 7, the number associated with the completion of God, and 3 * 4 is 12, the number of Jesus’s disciples. </p>

<p>By the time of 200 AD, Christianity was decentralized and sporadic (<a href="https://youtu.be/qW5SFpmg2HM?t=90" rel="nofollow"> vid </a> ). This would change in 306 AD ( <a href="https://www.worldhistory.org/Constantine_I/" rel="nofollow">x</a> ) when the Roman Emperor Constantine claimed he saw the following symbol in the sky and had his soldiers draw it on their shields before his battle against Maxentius. Constantine won the battle, allowing him to conquer Rome ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rKZAuKGGo0M&amp;ab_channel=ReligionForBreakfast" rel="nofollow">x0:00-1:00 </a>).  </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1015701107936329799/unknown.png" width="90" height="90" />The symbol attributed to Constantine’s conquest, named the Chi Rho for its resemblance of the union between the Greek letters Chi (P) and Rho (X).  </p>

<p>Constantine associated the symbol with Jesus, and hence Christianity became the official religion of Rome. Christianity, however, was not unified. This was not desired by Constantine and the Roman Catholic church was established under his reign. Before this, Constantine had been a worshiper of the sun god Sol Invictus (<a href="https://www.biblicalartifacts.com/items/1330548/CONSTANTINES-SUN-GOD-COIN-CHRISTIANITY-CULT-SOL-INVICTUS#:~:text=Unlike%20many%20ancient%20religions%20based,in%20the%20late%20Roman%20Empire." rel="nofollow">x</a>), which is likely part of why Jesus became so associated with the sun.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/980244089591197726/980244111317696552/stained-glass-window-of-the-crucifixion-holy-trinity-cathedral-addis-AMW5PN.jpg" />Jesus, the son who rises up to his father on Easter Sunday, with East being the direction the sun rises from.</p>

<p>In 325 AD, during the first council of Nicea, the church was divided over the following question: Was Jesus equal to God the Father? (<a href="https://www.history.com/this-day-in-history/council-of-nicaea-concludes#:~:text=Meeting%20at%20Nicaea%20in%20present,from%20their%20churches%20for%20heresy." rel="nofollow">x</a> ) The opposition to this was led by a bishop named Arius, while the support was led by the bishop who baptized Constatine, Eusebius ( <a href="https://archive.org/details/aselectlibraryn11wacegoog/page/556/mode/2up?view=theater" rel="nofollow">x</a> ). In the end, Eusebius managed to bribe the church against Arius ( <a href="https://youtu.be/6d2lOQpuqd4?t=257" rel="nofollow">x</a>), and the Catholic church officially accepted the Holy Trinity while Arius was exiled and possibly punched in the face. </p>

</p>

<p>The Catholic Trinity is something that I believe most are familiar with. It is the Catholic conception of God and to the majority of Catholics it argues God consists of a three-way unity between God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit (the actions of God <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Trinity-Christianity" rel="nofollow">x</a>). To John Dee, however, there was a hidden fourth component, or a “quaternary hidden within the ternary” and the following quote can be found in theorem XX of his book Monas Hieroglyphic.</p>

<p><em> “By this we demonstrate here that the quaternary is concealed within the ternary. Oh god, pardon me if I have sinned against thee by revealing such a great mystery, but I believe only those who are truly worthy will understand.” </em> –John Dee</p>

<p>This is why Dee’s favorite number was 7, as 3 + 4 = 7. Dee aligned his name to the trinity through the Greek letter Delta, Δ, which represents the trinity through the fact that it is a triangle but also represents a quaternary as it’s the fourth letter of the Greek alphabet. </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008018168133996544/unknown.png" /> The cover of Dee’s Propaedeumata Aphoristica shows letter Delta nestled between the words <em> quater narius in ternario conquiescens </em> , which translates to <em> resting four times in the ternary </em> ( <a href="https://translate.google.com/?sl=la&amp;tl=en&amp;text=quater%20nariuvs%20in%20ternario%20conquiescens&amp;op=translate&amp;hl=en" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p>Moving on to the other man I said was of importance to this essay, we have Edward De Vere, 17th Earl of Oxford. De Vere was an elite scholar and playwright of the Renaissance era (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_de_Vere,_17th_Earl_of_Oxford" rel="nofollow">x</a> ) and the man who this essay will argue at least appears to be responsible for some (although not all) of Shakespeare’s writings. De Vere became a ward of Queen Elizabeth in 1652 and was once described as “Thy countenance <b>shakes spears.</b> ” by a Cambridge fellow ( <a href="https://shakespeareoxfordfellowship.org/gabriel-harvey-genesis-of-shakespeare/" rel="nofollow">x</a>)</p>

In Hermetic art of the Renaissance era, a disembodied hand from the clouds symbolized the hand of God ( <a href="https://www.dreamstime.com/alchemical-hermetic-image-titled-magneticum-naturae-regnum-kircher-great-chain-composed-rings-stretched-sky-image200385691" rel="nofollow">x</a> , <a href="https://www.myjewishlearning.com/article/ezekiels-vision/" rel="nofollow">x</a> , <a href="https://fineartamerica.com/featured/-ars-magna-lucis-threefold-universe-science-source.html" rel="nofollow">x</a>). </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008413130419867720/unknown.png" /> The ace of pentacles, created by two members of the Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rider%E2%80%93Waite_tarot_deck" rel="nofollow">x</a> ). Considering the Hermetic obsession with Egyptian wisdom I think this hand motif likely echoes ancient Egyptian carvings of the sun god Aten ( <a href="http://www.globalegyptianmuseum.org/glossary.aspx?id=78" rel="nofollow">x</a> , <a href="https://ancientegyptonline.co.uk/amarnareligion/" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p>At this point I want to draw attention back to the quote from John Dee regarding finding the number of one's name and “registered within the book of Trinitie”. I would also like to draw attention to the following symbol, known as the Triple Tau.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008028782344536125/unknown.png" /> Triple Tau (<a href="https://freemasonry.bcy.ca/symbolism/triple_tau.html" rel="nofollow">x</a>). </p>

<p>The Triple Tau is composed of a trinity of Greek Taus, the Greek letter that became the English letter T. In many esoteric traditions, the letter T is seen as a reference to the crucifixion of Christ (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tau_cross" rel="nofollow">x</a>) and it is discussed with great interest within Dee’s Hieroglyphic Monad.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008029803305238659/unknown.png" />

</p>

<p>The Triple Tau is still used by Royal Arch Freemasons and in their traditions it is also seen as a T and an H as a reference to the initials of Hermes Trismegistus (<a href="https://m.facebook.com/TheEternalCircle/posts/the-thrice-great-hermes-trismegistus-piece-located-at-the-siena-cathedral-in-sie/564044764018307/" rel="nofollow">x</a>). Geometry is of extreme interest to the Freemasons, whose logo is a compass and straightedge around a G for Geometry, along with other meanings.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1009153628197629952/unknown.png" />Masonic logo on 3 4 5 triangle (<a href="https://bricksmasons.com/blogs/masonic-education/the-47th-problem-of-euclid#:~:text=The%2047th%20problem%20of%20Euclid%20is%20a%20perfect%20Freemasonry,sciences%20and%20the%20arts%20work." rel="nofollow">x</a>)</p>

<p> </p>

<p>The letters T and H also reference the Temple of Solomon (<a href="https://www.cityofgroveok.gov/building/page/royal-arch-mason-masonic#:~:text=The%20compound%20character%20known%20as,center%20joined%20at%20their%20base." rel="nofollow">x</a> ) ( <b>T</b> emplum <b>H</b> ierosolymae) in masonic tradition. The temple of Solomon has a reputation for having concealed occult secrets and upon reaching the third degree in modern Freemasonry, masonic initiates learn the story of Hiram Abiff, the alleged chief architect of Solomon’s temple who is said to be the origin of masonic building secrets ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiram_Abiff" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

</p>

<p>A map of the Temple of Solomon as drawn by Isacc Newton in <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/files/15784/15784-h/15784-h.htm" rel="nofollow"> The Chronology of Ancient Kingdoms Amended </a> (a book which contains the word <em> Solomon </em> 103 times, <em> Osiris </em>59 times) shows that the temple was pointed perfectly in the East towards the sunrise, implying the equinox (the day between the summer and winter solstices) were used in the building plans. This matches the points of the pyramid of Giza, which also point in all four cardinal directions (<a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/fall-equinox-secret-pyramids-near-perfect-alignment-180968223/" rel="nofollow">x</a>). This also identifies the cross as solar, linking the religious portrayal of Jesus ever closer to the sun.</p>

<p>Although the Triple Tao is a trinity of Ts, the word trinity is perhaps deceptive, as concealed within the Triple Tao rests a fourth T, upside down.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1015707956320419840/unknown.png" /> The fourth T, the first letter of trinity, triangle, and three hidden in the Triple Tao.</p>

<p>T is the 19th letter of the Greek alphabet and for the purpose of this essay, letters will have values of their place in the Latin alphabet, which was commonly used in the Renaissance era. 19 is also the number the Freemasons associate with God.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1009157907771818025/unknown.png" />(<a href="https://omniglot.com/writing/latin2.htm" rel="nofollow">x</a>)</p>

<p>Additionally, the Triple Tao contains 19 attributes; 5 lines, 6 points, and 8 angles. Therefore, the value of the Triple Tao should add to 57 (19x3 God), but it also secretly adds to 76 (19x4 God) due to the addition of the 4th T. </p>

<p>At this point I want to mention that I basically stole this entire argument for this section and most of these images from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCHN7SCKlsa9lPYJmqqQ2uIg" rel="nofollow"> this YouTuber </a> who makes the same argument I’m about to make but 1000x better. If you want a more thorough version of this argument I recommend these videos ( <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U-PWR7-0Hp4&amp;ab_channel=AlexanderWaugh" rel="nofollow">x</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hl2UOPB4BZc&amp;ab_channel=AlexanderWaugh" rel="nofollow">x</a> , <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J9epBV6P2Nk&amp;t=186s&amp;ab_channel=AlexanderWaugh" rel="nofollow">x</a>). </p>

<p>I will now attempt to connect Edward De Vere 17th Earl of Oxford to the Triple Tau, or the quaternary concealed within the ternary in the way which I believed he likely did himself. The phrase <em> Seventeenth Earl of </em> contains 17 characters, as well as the literal number 17. The word <em> Oxford </em> , as found in the title <em> Edward De Vere 17th Earl of Oxford </em> , has a value of 76 (14 + 21 + 6 + 14 + 17 + 4), meaning that <em> Oxford </em> has the same value as 4 Ts. Lastly, 4T is a pun of 40, which feels absurd to write but is unfortunately a crucial mechanic of this paper. 40 + 17 is also equal to 57, connecting 17 40 to both the number of 3 Ts and 4 Ts and if this doesn’t make sense hopefully the image below will clear it up.</p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008038511322083338/unknown.png" />
</p>

<p>17 + 40 = 57 </p>

<p>4T (4*19) = 76</p>

<p>Perhaps relying on a pun might not be enough to convince <em>some</em> <em>people</em> so I will also examine how De Vere encrypts the numbers 17 and 40 into his signature. You can also watch <a href="https://youtu.be/hl2UOPB4BZc?t=435" rel="nofollow">this video </a>if you would like to see more evidence that De Vere used the numbers 17 and 40 to align himself to the trinity, and by extension the quaternary, but I’d like to get things rolling at this point so I’m only going to give one more example. </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008038702741721118/unknown.png" width="914" height="311" /><br />
There seems to be the number 10 hidden in the ‘d’ and the ‘O’, and underneath the 10 are 7 dashes. 10 + 7 is 17.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008039680643707052/unknown.png" width="911" height="301" /><br />
Above the 10 is a ‘m’, the first letter of multiplicare, the Latin word for multiply. Above the m are 4 dots, and obviously 4x10 is 40.</p>

<p>I understand that all of this might come across as “pointless shenanigans of fanciful men with too much time on their hands”, which is fair. “Fanciful shenanigans” of this nature were extremely common among Renaissance scholars (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/24464618" rel="nofollow">x</a> , <a href="https://math.dartmouth.edu/~matc/math5.geometry/unit8/unit8.html" rel="nofollow">x</a> ) and we can see the numbers 17 and 40 mirrored in the name William Shakespeare. The W was not invented until 1700 ( <a href="https://www.daytranslations.com/blog/origin-english-alphabet/#:~:text=The%20letter%20'W'%20started%20during,letter%20'W'%20in%201700." rel="nofollow">x</a> ), so to those in the Renaissance it was known as the double V and has a value of 40 (20+20). The W, or double V is then followed by 17 characters <em> (illiam Shakespeare </em>).</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008195559632404570/unknown.png" />The letter W, if drawn like such gives 3 triangles (red, blue, orange) + and inverted fourth triangle (green, sorry Kai). The W is taken from a dedication to Susan Vere (<a href="https://shakespeareoxfordfellowship.org/bestow-how-and-when/" rel="nofollow">x</a>), the daughter of Edward De Vere.</p>

<p>I will now move on to some examples of the numbers 17 40 as encrypted in various Shakespearian artifacts which will hopefully be significantly more interesting. Up first is a page from the book Polimanteia, an 1595 novel which heavily references Shakespeare (<a href="https://shakespearedocumented.folger.edu/resource/document/polimenteia-earliest-printed-direct-reference-shakespeares-venus-and-adonis-and" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008197993314394283/unknown.png" />
</p>

<p>If we count backwards from the bottom of the page (not counting the uncomplete a- and counting <em> courte-deare-verfe </em> as one word) we find that the word <em> Oxford </em> rests in the 17th space from the end, right next to an inverted triangle of <em> for </em> above a T. Additionally, this T is the fourth T in the line counting from left to right. Below the word Oxford is the phrase <em> courte-deare-verse </em> (the <em> f </em> symbol was used as <em> s </em> at the time), which gives us a perfect anagram of <em> our de vere a secret. </em> </p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008200695436030024/unknown.png" /><br />
<br />
</p>

<p>The next object of interest is the dedication to the Shakespeare sonnets, published in the year of John Dee’s death (1609). The dedication is laid out in three triangles, giving us a trinity of trinities. If you count the line lengths of the triangles you will find their lines values to be 6, 2, and then 4. </p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008202221613228103/unknown.png" />
</p>

<p>6, 2, and 4 are also in relation to Edward De Vere, as his name contains words with letter lengths of 6, 2, and 4, and his title Earl of Oxford contains letter lengths of 4, 2, and 6. De Vere also died on June 24th (<a href="https://politicworm.com/2014/02/17/oxfords-death/" rel="nofollow">x</a>), or 6, 24.</p>

<p>If the words in the sequence 6 2 4 are isolated (demonstrated below), we get the message THESE SONNETS ALL BY EVER THE FORTH T. The word Ever is an anagram of Vere. </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008222879265063103/unknown.png" /><br />
If we only examine the final paragraph we see that the 17th T in the page rests within the word <em> forth </em> . The word <em> forth </em> itself also rests within a triangle topped with three Ts for a total of four Ts.  </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008223879644332083/unknown.png" /><br />
I mentioned earlier that the dedication is laid out into three triangles, which implies there must be a hidden fourth triangle. If we take the letters in the center triangle, we can rearrange them like so, in an upright triangle. </p>

<p>

<p>G (God <a href="https://bricksmasons.com/blogs/masonic-education/the-masonic-letter-g" rel="nofollow">x</a>) and double V.</p>

<p>Not only was Vero Nihil Verius a motto of De Vere (<a href="https://go.gale.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA528468462&amp;sid=googleScholar&amp;v=2.1&amp;it=r&amp;linkaccess=abs&amp;issn=15256863&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;userGroupName=anon%7E5ee42da1" rel="nofollow">x</a>), but the phrase contains a double V.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008226020677124096/unknown.png" /> De Vere’s motto as part of the Oxford coat of arms (<a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Oxford_coat_of_arms.jpg" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p>The dedication contains a total of 19 Ts including the T. T. sign off. Given John Dee’s obsession (<a href="https://manyheadedmonster.com/2012/11/09/john-dees-conversations-with-angels/" rel="nofollow">x</a>) of putting letters into grids…</p>

<p>

<p>…I believe it’s not unreasonable to examine this dedication in a grid of letters with 19 rows. </p>

<p>
  <img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1008418140830576790/unknown.png" />
</p>

<p>The word FOURTH rests at the bottom of the grid, touching the three Ts stacks vertically. If an inverted T of grid spaces is drawn over the center of the word FORTH and the letters examined, we find an upside down ‘Vere’ with the letters ‘De’ left over. </p>

<p>I’ve already shown this to a few people but I hope at this point the significance of four triangles is further understood. Two points on the page have been marked in blue and four points have been marked in red by me. With the red points, four perfect Pythagorean right triangles can be created with the hypotenuse as the distance between the two blue points. Furthermore, the outer points of all four triangles can all be connected along the same circle. </p>

<p>Four triangles also add to an angle value of 720 degrees, which is shared by the angle value of the Triple Tau.  </p>

<p>If an elongated Chi Roe (a symbol which consists of the Roe, the 17th letter of the Greek alphabet and the Chi, which has a value of 40 in biblical gematria (<a href="https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/how-biblical-gematria-entered-the-greek-script/#attachment_662274" rel="nofollow">x</a> ) is drawn on the sonnet page by connecting the P at the top to the dot after the <em> for T </em>…</p>

We can isolate the letters <em> By G. </em> and <em> De Vere </em> (U was used as V in the time, hence the word neuer instead of never). Furthermore, if this circle were to be imposed onto a map of The Westminster St. Peter’s South Cross Isle ( <a href="https://www.lookandlearn.com/history-images/U246646/Plan-of-Poets-Corner-Westminster-Abbey" rel="nofollow">x</a>) and scaled so that the center of the center pillar marked the center of the circle and the center of the top pillar as the edge of the circle…</p>

…we would find the dot after for T. to be the exact point of the Westminster Shakespeare monument.</p>

</p>

<p>The Shakespeare monument in the Westminster was designed by the Freemason (<a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/43489731" rel="nofollow">x</a> ) William Kent ( <a href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/661464/shakespeares-monument-westminster-abbey" rel="nofollow">x</a>). The monument, a piece of stone masonry, features Shakespeare standing under a royal arch (haha get it?).  </p>

<p>If we examine the scroll he points at we see his finger gestures to the line <em> The Solemn Temples </em>, a clear reference to the Temple of Solomon. At the top of the plaque rests a phrase which I have been told contains 17 characters, although I can’t read the final word well enough to tell if it’s 17 or 18.</p>

<p>

<br />
</p>

<p>Either way, the 4 Ts complement the Stratford monument to Shakespeare, which contains a block of four Ts above a line of 13 characters, creating a total of 17 characters. </p>

<br />
</p>

<p>Lastly, the Wilton monument (<a href="https://countryhousehistories.omeka.net/items/show/32" rel="nofollow">x</a>), constructed in 1740 in the Holy Trinity church contains a plaque with the letters ED (Edward Oxford) and WR (40 and 17) to the right of Shakespeare’s finger. </p>

<br />
</p>

<p>If we were to map out all three of these monuments (top Stratford bottom left Wilton house), we would find that they form a nearly perfect equilateral triangle with the city of Oxford in the center.</p>

  <b>PART 3: THE GREAT ARCHITECT OF THE UNIVERSE</b>
</p>

<p>We could continue in this fashion and find more 1740s used by both De Vere and within Shakespearian artifacts but my interest in this subject rests less in encryption and more with getting people to understand the purpose of this madness. There are two purposes: The first is that these encryptions are meant to prove the power of a Fraternity to an initiate of that fraternity while still keeping a secret. The second reason, dependent on the first, is to “immortalize the fanciman” in the eyes of a fraternity. </p>

<p>

</p>

<p>It is my hope the reader may begin to see the significance of a hand pulling up De Vere and his W shaped collar up to the sky.</p>

<p>This is what I believe the masons truly are; a glorified and elaborate funeral service. I can’t say for certain if De Vere was really Shakespeare, or how much of his writing actually ended up getting published in Shakespeare’s name. But I can give my opinion that in the eyes of fraternity men wishing to be immortalized, the functionality of Shakespeare was of a collective literary soul to which one could align themselves to in an attempt to achieve immortal life. Such I believe was the case with emperor Constantine, the sun-worshiping king for whom the physical likeness of depictions of Christ mirror, or perhaps has simply been retroactively painted to resemble.</p>

<p>The word <b>cult</b> comes from the word oc<b>cult</b> (x), which means to keep something hidden. For the purpose of this essay, a cult is an organization structured to give a minority power over a majority. This structure takes the form of a multiple-step pyramid, up which the cult member ascends through a series of initiations.</p>

<p>I believe that if you were to ask the average Catholic church goer their opinions on what the church taught, they would not disagree with the following statements.</p><ol>
<li>Human beings are not God, but are separated from God and not part of the trinity.</li>
<li>You get to heaven by accepting Jesus as your savior, or perhaps by good deeds. </li>
<li>Jesus was a specific person who was born in 4-7 AD and crucified by the Roman government, he was <b>not</b> also Orphious, Horus, Ra, Dionysus, or Pythagorus.</li>
<li>The bible teaches one how to be with God, not how to be a god.</li>
<li>The consumption of the fruit of knowledge of Good and Evil was a disaster that separated humans from God and was in disobedience to the will of God. </li>
</ol>

<p>I’m not going to pretend that the bible is not self-contradictory because the Bible is a book written by thousands of different people at different times with different wills. But I believe it is fair to say that the bible teaches that humans should not be gods, and that the net value of the actions of society are negative because humans need influence from God to be moral. The first part of the book of Genesis begins with humanity's separation from God per their consumption of the fruit of knowledge of Good and Evil. (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A2-13&amp;version=KJ21" rel="nofollow">x</a>)</p>

<p><b> <em>2 </em> </b> <em> And the woman said unto the serpent, “We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden, </em></p>

<p><b> <em>3 </em> </b> <em> but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, ‘Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it,lest ye die.’” </em></p>

<p><b> <em>4 </em> </b> <em> And the serpent said unto the woman, “Ye shall not surely die; </em></p>

<p><b> <em>5 </em> </b> <em> for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil.” </em></p>

<p><b> <em>6 </em> </b> <em> And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof and ate, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he ate. </em></p>

<p><b> <em>22 </em> </b> <em> And the Lord God said, “Behold, the man has become as gods, knowing good and evil. And now, lest he put forth his hand and take also of the tree of life, and eat and live for ever”— </em></p>

<p>This separation is presented as a catastrophe and the remainder of the Bible follows humanity’s attempts to escape the mental and physical slavery they find themselves in and return to God. I believe it is not without coincidence that the Torah is attributed to the Hebrews during the period of time in which they were slaves to the Egyptian royals. Nor is it without coincidence that the first man’s name is Adam, as compared to Atum. It is also said that God puts up a cherubim in the East to guard the Tree of Life (<a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+3%3A24&amp;version=NIV" rel="nofollow">x</a>), and East is the direction the sun (Atum) moves away from.</p>

<p>I also believe any amount of research on the teachings of Hermetism or Egyptian mysticism will identify them closer to the Knowledge of Good and Evil, but that is an entirely different paper. I am not sure if I would consider myself religious and I don’t know what it means to find Jesus but I do not find him within the trinity. It’s beyond deceptive that the vast majority of Christians are unaware of the “secret meanings” of the trinity believed by powerful fraternities within the Church that completely contradict what the Church teaches to the masses. I believe it is truly a great hypocrisy that the largest Christian organization in the world is worshiping what is essentially an Egyptian pharaoh.</p>

<p>At this point I would like to mention that I would be far less interested in the shenanigans of the Catholic Church if we didn’t find ourselves living in a post-Catholic world. The Catholic Church links the empire of Rome to the Empire of Britain, neither of which are tiny blips in history. The Catholic church still has massive power today. The Knights of Malta, a sovereign entity of international law (and also the name of a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knights_Templar_(Freemasonry)#:~:text=The%20Degree%20of%20Knight%20of%20Malta%20(Order%20of%20Malta),-The%20Maltese%20Cross&amp;text=This%20degree%20is%20universally%20associated,subsequently%20to%20the%20Templar%20Degree." rel="nofollow"> degree in Freemasonry </a> ), give the Catholic Church a spot in the United Nations ( <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sovereign_Military_Order_of_Malta" rel="nofollow">x</a>). This is why, I believe, that numerous references to the shenanigans of the Catholic Church can be found on the dollar bill. </p>

<p>Earlier I mentioned that the name Jesus adds to 444 in gematria. Three fours, so where’s the fourth? If we multiply 444 by 4 we get 1776, the date both that the U.S.A was founded and the Freemason Adam Weishaupt founded the Bavarian Illuminati (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illuminati" rel="nofollow">x</a>). The number can be seen in Roman numerals on the dollar bill at the base of an Egyptian pyramid, the 3 dimensional shape created from four triangles and a square base. </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1015718799640641606/unknown.png" />Haha guys but what if the Illuminati was the Catholic church like honestly I think there’s some comedic value here? Like come on guys let’s have some fun let’s crack a few jokes.</p>

<p>There’s one more triangle of interest in the date 1776, but I’m getting lazy at this point so I’m just going to upload a screenshot (below) from someone else who explained it (<a href="https://www.biblegematria.com/pythagoras.html" rel="nofollow">x</a> also I very much recommend this link, it’s very interesting).</p>

<p>The 3-4-5 right triangle is worshiped by the Freemasons (<a href="https://www.masonic-lodge-of-education.com/47th-problem-of-euclid.html" rel="nofollow">x</a>) and this is just a 3-4-5 triangle multiplied by 222.</p>

<p>Moving back to the actual image on the dollar, the sun rests behind the tip of the Egyptian pyramid, both of which are devices used to transport the dead Pharaoh's soul to the stars to be as a god (<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20020817021937/http://www.philae.nu/akhet/NetjeruA.html" rel="nofollow">x</a>). </p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/954569113055936534/994648934628737157/unknown.png" />Atum sails through the night sky behind the sun to be reborn.</p>

<p>Additionally, Adam Weishaupt was a member of the Jesuits (aka the Society of Jesus), a fraternal order of the Catholic Church (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jesuits" rel="nofollow">x</a>). The Jesuit logo (below) shows both a compass-like sun and a variation of the Triple Tao.</p>

<p><img src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/1007427817476214794/1015719544196702320/unknown.png" width="453" height="427" /> Beautiful transparent image of the Jesuit abbreviation IHS, which, among other things, references the words of Constantine after seeing the Chi Rho in the sky (<a href="http://www.jesuswalk.com/christian-symbols/ihs.htm" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p>The pyramid sits above the phrase <em> Novus Ordo Seclorum </em> , which translates to <em> New Order of the Worlds </em> and is a good way to describe the formation of the British empire. So not only do we have the grave of the dead pharaoh, but on the other side of the dollar sits the American eagle in its astounding similarity to Horus ( <a href="http://www.museumofmythology.com/Egypt/horus_the_elder.htm" rel="nofollow">x</a>).</p>

<p>haha wow guys what a coincidence </p>

<p>Okay guys I really want to keep talking about the secrets of the dollar bill but this is already 12 pages of text and I haven’t added the pictures yet so I’m going to cut it here. I really hope my point came across, that despite the fact that the occult Goes Hard, they are just as elitist and untrustworthy as you would expect an organization that controls which people know or don’t know specific pieces of information to be.</p>

<p>I know I only gave a few examples but I hope people will give me the benefit of the doubt when I say that all cults teach the same thing, that god is a concentrated point of divinity/light from which all emanates and everything in existence is god so humans are part of god and they should ascend through ranks with knowledge to become closer to/align themselves with the most concentrated part of god but when you advance through the ranks they start to say “oh some people are more divine than others” and then you learn that what being a god really means to them is being a king, it’s being a “god” of the world. I don’t like kings, and I don’t like information warfare, but unfortunately I believe we find ourselves living under the power of the modern equivalent of them. When you speak to an occultist you are speaking to someone who is withholding information from you regarding the nature of their organization, and who has had information withheld from them. I do not wish harm on the individuals in the occult and honestly most people are involved with the occult in one way or another and just don’t realize it, and I only want to help people understand the secret keeping of the Catholic church as I believe it’s wrong that it’s been hidden from those at the bottom of the pyramid okay I’m done writing now holy shit. </p>
