</br><p>
<p>Spending thirty six hours in Sweden proved itself less than fine. After just half a day of being cooped up in a hotel room together, the four of them found that tensions grew when they weren't working towards a common goal.</p>
<p>"You're not my <em>real </em>dad!" Tala sobbed.</p>
<p>"What--huh?" Tex replied.</p>
<p>"Why must I wear pants inside the same room as I sleep?" Junji asked as he pounded his fist against the table. "I demand answers!"</p>
<p>Barton let out a long groan and grabbed Tala's bag off of one of the two beds. Tala's crying came to an immediate halt.</p>
<p>"What are you doing?" Tala wondered.</p>
<p>"Getting the Pain Finder Thing." answered Barton.</p>
<p>Curious, Tex stood next to Barton as she pulled the box from the bag. The dot in Japan was still present, but Barton zoomed in until they were only viewing everything in a thirty mile radius.</p>
<p>"Oh, we doing another side quest?" Tex asked.</p>
<p>"We're getting out of this room, that's for sure." she replied.</p>
<p>The largest dot was just a few miles away. It looked just a bit bigger than the one for the coma patient had been.</p>
<p>Tala looked up the address on her phone.</p>
<p>"Looks like it's some sort of theater." said Tala.</p>
<p>"Woah, it's got really bad reviews." Barton noted as she read over Tala's shoulder.</p>
<p>"What do they say?" Tex wondered.</p>
<p>"Not sure. They're in Swedish."</p>
<p>They took a bus into a posh part of town to search for the theater. Using Google Maps, they found it just off the sidewalk next to an intersection. The insane events of the day before were still fresh in Tex&rsquo;s mind, but they avoided speaking about it now that they&rsquo;d turned their phones back on.</p>
<p>It took them an hour to get there. The dot had long since disappeared by the time they&rsquo;d arrived, but they&rsquo;d decided to continue with their investigation nonetheless.</p>
<p>It was a tall and wide building, and several unlit signs over the door indicated it commonly held some kind of event. Tex wished he could read the writing.</p>
<p>None of the locals paid the building any attention.</p>
<p>The front of it looked like the front of a large movie theater. Barton tried one of the doors to find it was unlocked.</p>
<p>"Guess we got nothing to lose." Tex mumbled as he held the door open for everyone.</p>
<p>Past a horizontal hallway with some bathrooms and drinking fountains were rows and rows of built-in seats that covered the floor almost all the way down to a giant projector screen. There was nothing on the screen, but Tex still felt compelled to take a closer look.</p>
<p>The room was eerily empty. He almost jumped when the door shut under its own weight behind them.</p>
<p>"If we ever get murdered, it would probably be in here." Barton said helpfully as they made their way down to the screen.</p>
<p>After climbing onto the tiny stage before the screen, Tex reached his fingers out towards the screen to find it was made of a fluid fabric.</p>
<p>"We should check under it." he suggested. "Seems a little suspicious."</p>
<p>Junji lifted a bit of the screen from the bottom. Tex caught sight of a small section of a computer.</p>
<p>Not wanting to risk moving the screen around too much, Tex got down on his knees and shoved his head under the fabric. He could see more of the computer as he lifted his head up, and more still when he started to strain his neck.</p>
<p>After lying down with his back to the floor, Tex still couldn't see the top of the computer.</p>
<p>"What's back there?" Tala asked.</p>
<p>"A bunch of porn." Tex answered.</p>
<p>"What genre?"</p>
<p>"Uh, incest."</p>
<p>"You have to be more specific."</p>
<p>"I wanna see." said Barton.</p>
<p>"Too late." Tex replied. "Now it's just Seinfeld reruns."</p>
<p><em>"Hejsan!" </em>a new voice called.</p>
<p>Tex frantically pulled his head out from the curtain and stood to see a dog and a middle-aged woman in a lab coat rushing down to them from the entrance they'd come in through.</p>
<p>The dog, a shockingly silver retriever, was attached to a red leash. It was tugging the woman along and leaving her struggling not to teeter over in the tall heels she was wearing. Tex could see that the woman was tall and beautiful, with a glowing, oval face and a long ponytail of blonde hair.</p>
<p>She was struggling to catch her breath by the time she&rsquo;d closed in on them and came to a stop. Her dog took a seat by her heels.</p>
<p><em>'Can pet? </em>' Tex wondered.</p>
<p>"Hello." Junji greeted.</p>
<p>The woman frowned upon hearing Junji's voice. Tex only realized at that moment that her dog was made from a detailed array of jointed metal parts.</p>
<p>"Speak English?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Yeepers." Tala replied.</p>
<p>The woman's face twisted with confusion.</p>
<p>"That means yes." said Tex. "Yes, we speak English."</p>
<p>"Oh!" the woman replied with a clap of her hands. "Very good!"</p>
<p>Tex made eye contact with the dog, trying to understand how it worked. The dog met his gaze back with two silver eyes.</p>
<p>Without warning, it lurched forward in Tex's direction.</p>
<p><em>"Voff! Voff!" </em>the dog yipped, pulling the woman along with it.</p>
<p>The dog's mouth wasn&rsquo;t moving. Tex figured the bark must have come from a speaker inside its throat.</p>
<p>"Nej, Roffe! Nej!" the woman yelped.</p>
<p>As Roffe the dog sniffed at Tex's ankles, his owner came crashing into Barton. Barton didn't even blink.</p>
<p>"Gay." Barton stated as she peeled the woman off herself.</p>
<p>Tex knelt down and scraped his fingers against the smooth, cold metal behind Roffe's ears.</p>
<p><em>'Pet. </em>' he thought.</p>
<p>"Sorry about dog." said the woman.</p>
<p><em>"English detected.</em>" Roffe barked in an automated male voice. <em>"Switching language to English.</em>"</p>
<p>The woman dusted herself off and straightened her shoulders. Roffe rolled over, teaching Tex that robot dogs also had testicles.</p>
<p>"I am Doctor Lofgren." the woman explained as she pointed to herself. "What can I help you with?"</p>
<p>Tex exchanged an uncertain glance with Barton. He had no idea how to even begin explaining to her why they'd come.</p>
<p>"We're investigating a...minor disturbance." Tex replied. "Has anything strange been happening here?"</p>
<p>"Strange?" asked Dr. Lofgren. "No."</p>
<p>"We saw you got a pretty impressive computer. You wouldn't be tetragramming, would you?"</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren's eyes went wide.</p>
<p>"No!" she yelped. "They are not conscious. It is just coin flips."</p>
<p>"Who isn't conscious?" Barton asked.</p>
<p>"I just do presentations. I would never tetragram."</p>
<p>"Presentations?"</p>
<p>"Yes. I do presentation for you?"</p>
<p>Tex gave his coworkers a glance to find they all seemed various levels of interested.</p>
<p>"I'm alright with that." Tex slowly replied. "Are y'all alright with that?"</p>
<p>Junji and Barton grumbled that they were. Tala clapped her hands with excitement.</p>
<p>"Yay!" Dr. Lofgren said with a clap of her own. "Please follow me."</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren situated herself on the far side of the stage, right next to the edge of the screen. After a few seconds of hesitation, Tex followed her to see she&rsquo;d taken a stand in front of a small, ATM-like machine with a tiny monitor.</p>
<p>A messy line formed in front of him.</p>
<p>"Come forward when ready." Dr. Lofgren instructed. "Do not worry, there will be no pain."</p>
<p>Tala stepped forward first. Tex strained his neck to watch as Dr. Lofgren plucked a single strand of Tala's hair and put it in a little slot in the machine.</p>
<p>Nothing happened. Dr. Lofgren frowned and tapped her fist against the machine.</p>
<p>"Roffe, will you please organize backroom wires?" she asked.</p>
<p><em>"When would you like that done by?" </em>Roffe replied.</p>
<p>"Quick as you are physically able."</p>
<p><em>"I could complete the task faster if I knew more commands. You have restricted me from teaching myself more commands. Would you like me to override this restriction?"</em></p>
<p>"Ja. Ja. Whatever."</p>
<p>Roffe disappeared under the curtain. A moment later, words began to rapidly flash on the monitor.</p>
<p>Tex struggled to read them.</p>
<p><em>Female. Twenty-six. Ninety-two percent Native American. Eight percent Northern European. One point six meters tall. Preferred weight of sixty-one kilo--</em></p>
<p>The words began to go by too quickly for Tex to understand them, but Dr. Lofgren seemed content.</p>
<p>"Next person." she ordered.</p>
<p>Barton was next in line. Dr. Lofgren frowned at Barton's hat.</p>
<p>"No hair?" she asked as she reached into the pocket of her lab coat. "Will have to do finger prick."</p>
<p>Barton didn't resist in the slightest as she placed her finger inside the tiny box that was held out for her.</p>
<p><em>Female. Sixty-one. One hundred percent East African. One point eight meters tall. Preferred weight of fifty-one kilograms. Hair colo--</em></p>
<p>"Woah, that just gave me a rush." said Barton. "Prick the other one, too."</p>
<p>"No."</p>
<p>Junji was next after Barton. He handed a hair to Dr. Lofgren that he&rsquo;d apparently already plucked from himself.</p>
<p>She placed it in the machine. After a few seconds of processing, the monitor began to blink with confusion regarding &lsquo;inconsistencies&rsquo;.</p>
<p>"Are you transgender man?" Dr. Lofgren wondered.</p>
<p>"I don't know." Junji replied.</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren's eyes opened wide with fear.</p>
<p>"He's a man--thing." Tex stammered.</p>
<p>After a few moments of consideration, Dr. Lofgren manually typed 'male' into the machine and hit enter.</p>
<p>The rest of Junji's data seemed to file in just fine, which meant it was Tex's turn. He did his best not to flinch as Lofgren pulled a strand of his hair.</p>
<p><em>Male. Thirty-eight. Eighteen percent Latin American. Twelve percent South American. Forty percent Northern European. Nineteen percent Southern European.</em></p>
<p>"Can we place our bets on the last percent?" asked Tala.</p>
<p><em>One percent Central African </em>.</p>
<p>Barton pulled a piece of paper out of her pocket and scribbled something on it. She handed it to Tex.</p>
<p>It read 'N-word pass'.</p>
<p>Tex winced as he slipped it into his pocket, unprepared for the responsibility.</p>
<p>"Most of this does not matter." Dr. Lofgren explained. "Please do not mind machine."</p>
<p>After they'd all been thoroughly scanned, several pages of information printed out of the side of the machine. Lofgren picked up the papers and fixed them to a clipboard before Tex could get a good look.</p>
<p>Roffe reappeared from under the curtains. He took a seat next to Tex&rsquo;s foot.</p>
<p>"May I start simulation?" Dr. Lofgren asked as she pulled a remote from her pocket.</p>
<p>Tex didn't see why not, so he let out a mumble of affirmation along with everyone else. Dr. Lofgren pointed her remote at the screen and pressed several buttons.</p>
<p>The giant screen of the theater hummed to life with a moving picture. Tex took a look to see two people phase into view.</p>
<p>They were a male and an older female. The male's torso was covered in a pattern of horizontally striped tattoos, while the female's torso was covered in vertical ones. The only clothing they wore were strips of fabric over their genitalia. They were frighteningly high up in a tree, and the male was supporting the female like an expert trapeze artist.</p>
<p>The background was all savanna.</p>
<p>"Who are they?" Tex wondered.</p>
<p>"You." Dr. Lofgren replied as she pointed to him and Barton. "And her."</p>
<p>Tex re-examined the male's face in awe. His features were stronger, his skin was darker, and he was covered in more body hair, but Tex could distantly see the resemblance.</p>
<p>"How&rsquo;d you make us cavemen?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Recreated your inherent neurology and physiology in simulation." answered Dr. Lofgren. "Put them in hunter-gatherer times as babies."</p>
<p>"How did you get data for hunter-gatherer times, though?" Tala pushed. "We don't have any."</p>
<p>"Machine creates a group of randomized human assets and raises them by Bonobo monkeys. Then machine speeds up time for several thousand generations until humans have developed complex language and culture."</p>
<p>Tex felt a wave of gratefulness that he'd previously learned what an asset was.</p>
<p>"Hell's a Bonobo monkey?" he wondered.</p>
<p>"Bonobo is human's closest relative." Dr. Lofgren explained fondly. "They are intelligent and altruistic species without war or infanticide."</p>
<p>"...Sounds nice."</p>
<p>"Yes. They also fuck children, but I did not want to mention."</p>
<p>While Tex suppressed a wave of nausea, the male and female in the tree began to bicker with one another. Dr. Lofgren pressed a button on her remote and the words 'translating to English' flashed across the screen.</p>
<p>"This female is respected elder." she said as she pointed to the older female on the screen. "She came into power by sheer force of old age."</p>
<p>"Good for her." Barton replied.</p>
<p>"You said they don't feel, right?" asked Tala.</p>
<p>"No." Dr. Lofgren replied. "Not conscious."</p>
<p>Tex examined the screen with thought. He believed Dr. Lofgren that they couldn't feel, but he couldn't help wondering what they would be thinking if they could.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Just a little higher, Spia." said Dagut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia grit his teeth and pushed Dagut up a few more inches. His thighs burned from suffering five hours of constant strain, but they were almost finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Got it." Dagut followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Her weight became easier to support the moment her fingers had reached the branch. Still, Spia pushed until Dagut was able to get one of her legs next to her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Here." Spia grunted as he passed her the bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Dagut took the bag. With nothing else to capture his attention, Spia watched as she pulled out the fire stick and began to twist it rapidly into a grove in the bark on the branch she was seated on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The hive they were after was inside a hollow in the tree. Once Dagut had made a tiny flame, she pulled out a tied mess of dry leaves from the bag, lit the end, and shoved it into the hollow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Did you blow on it?" asked Spia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"Did you blow on it?" </em>Dagut echoed before pushing her thumbs together to create a tiny hole and blowing through it onto the fire.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Dagut was a niht female elder who Spia had known his entire life. She was a pain in the ass, but Spia loved her, and he knew she loved him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Once the bees had been properly incapacitated, Dagut began to pass the chunks of honeycomb down to Spia. Spia made a silent reminder to himself not to touch his hair until he washed his hands.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">There were several dead bees stuck in the honeycomb. Spia tried not to think about how delicious they looked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Getting down the tree was even harder than getting up, but it was their last climb of the day. Every muscle in Spia's body begged to be given a rest, but his mind knew doing so would result in injury and the loss of a perfectly good honeycomb, seven eggs, and some leaves that could be made into a resin that killed pain for the small price of severe diarrhea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia leaned up against the tree and wiped the thick sweat from his brow the second they'd gotten back to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You ready to run back home?" Dagut asked him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"No."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You'll be fine. It's only 9.736 kilometers."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"...What?" asked Tala.</p>
<p>"They have their own units of distance." Dr. Lofgren explained. "Language translator translates into metric."</p>
<p>"Oh, that makes sense."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia groaned, but he knew he could do it. He did it everyday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Although that didn&rsquo;t make it easy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Okay, work is over." Dagut panted as they slowed to a halt near the end of their village. "Time to rest for ten hours."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"Uhhg. </em>"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You're fine."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">It was usually the time that Spia would set out to find his friends, but this time, they found him first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">They must have been waiting for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia's two best friends were Raif, a male, and Hudin, a younger niht female. He loved both of them very much and knew they loved him in return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...not saying it was aliens." Raif finished to Hudin. "I'm saying we can't rule out the possibility that it <em>was </em>aliens."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"I believe that is us." Junji noted to Tala.</p>
<p>"Nice to know we would all still hang out if we didn't have mercy killing to bring us together." Tala replied.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hello." Spia said as he greeted them by bending his right arm, extending his left, and dipping his head into his bent arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">His friends returned the greeting.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Oh my god." Tala muttered.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"How are you doing, Raif?" asked Spia.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"These are the stupidest names I've ever heard." Barton said.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You smell bad." Raif replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Thanks. Did you two hunt anything?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Hudin held up a stick with two roasted birds shoved on it. They smelled delicious, but the sensation only made Spia a very familiar kind of uncomfortable.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Raif tried to hunt a boar by himself." answered Hudin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Did it work?" Spia wondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Am I holding a boar?" Raif replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"No."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Do I look like I've just had to run for my life?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yes."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">They dropped off their food at the communal table. Everything looked appealing to Spia, although he didn't have the time to hide away and eat anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Why was he trying to hunt a boar by himself?" Spia asked Hudin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"No one would help him." she answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Despite the fact that Spia and Hudin both openly liked Raif, their collective status apparently wasn't enough to raise his.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You should do honey and eggs with Dagut and I." Spia suggested to Raif. "We could use a third."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...I'm allergic to bee stings." Raif replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia winced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You two do smell terrible." Hudin said. "Let's go to the river."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We should stop by the cchit first." Dagut replied. &ldquo;We need more soap."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Everyone mumbled in agreement, and they took off towards the river. They only stopped once to grab a cup of boiled ash and animal fat from a group of cchit females at the far end of camp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Thank you." Spia said to the female who'd given him the soap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">She had wide hips and diagonally striped tattoos across her chest, as did all cchit. Spia had seen her a few times before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Have fun." she chuckled.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Hell's a cchit?" asked Tex.</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren paused the simulation with her remote and glanced down at her clipboard.</p>
<p>"One of their three squibders." she answered. "Males, nihts, and ccihts. Females have been broken into two groups based on body weight."</p>
<p>"For what?" Tala pushed.</p>
<p>"Cchit females are responsible for childbirth and gathering fruit. Niht females hunt bird and bugs."</p>
<p>Tex felt his face twist with confusion.</p>
<p>"What's a squibder?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Who knows?" Lofgren replied.</p>
<p>"Who cares?" Barton grunted.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The walk to the river wasn't long. Still, they managed to run into a large group of children following two adults whose names Spia didn't know.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">All of the children were at least five, as was expected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hello!" one of the adults greeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Along with everyone else, Spia bent his right arm, extended his left, and dipped his head into his bent arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"So you're on kid duty today, huh?" Dagut asked one of the adults.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">While Dagut talked to the adults, Spia searched the group to see if any of his kids were present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Daddy!" a voice called.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia turned his attention in the direction of the voice and smiled wide when he saw who it was.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p><em>"Oh. </em>" Tex muttered, loud enough for only himself to hear.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia was nearly knocked over as his son came running over to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Kames." Spia snickered. "Hey, buddy."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I made an art!" Kames yelled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia was handed a clay sculpture painted with different colors of berry juice. He examined it with care.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"It's--good." Spia said as he gave the sculpture back to Kames.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">It wasn't good. Spia stepped on Raif's foot before he could give Kames any advice on complementary colors.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Thank you!" Kames replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You remember we're having family night with your mother the day after tomorrow, right?" asked Spia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yes!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Uh, could you remind me who your mother is again?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Pulin."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh good. It's always nice to see her."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">After giving Spia one more promise that he would be on time, Kames ran off with his terrible statue to rejoin his friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia hadn&rsquo;t been lying when he&rsquo;d said it would be nice to see Pulin. He liked her the best of all the females he&rsquo;d gotten pregnant, even if most of the village thought she was strange for only wanting to have sex with men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The group moved on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"That reminds me." Dagut said. "We're on kid duty tomorrow."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia&rsquo;s face lit up with happiness. Kid duty was always his favorite day of the week.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The second half of the walk to the river was uneventful. Spia became more aware of just how dirty his hands were the closer they got.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Hudin took off her clothes immediately upon getting to the river bank. Spia thought nothing of it, as he did the same.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Can we get some black bars on the window?" Tex asked in a tone less nervous than he felt.</p>
<p>"No." Dr. Lofgren replied. "Be big boy."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You guys ready?" Hudin asked as she jumped in the water.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Sure." Dagut replied. "I can't get horny anymore, but I'll watch."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Bathing in the river was one of Spia's favorite parts of the day. He especially enjoyed their cultural tradition of taking turns washing each other's hair and giving each other oral sex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>'This sure is neat.</em>' Spia thought to himself as his hair was washed and he was given oral sex.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Ahh!" Tex yelped, shoving his face into his hands.</p>
<p>"Man, that's a lot of bisexuality." Barton noted.</p>
<p>"All ships are canon." said Tala.</p>
<p>"Skip it, <em>please. </em>" Tex begged.</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren rolled her eyes but sped forward a few minutes.</p>
<p>At the very least, Tex had learned that his penis would be bigger than Junji's, had Junji been in possession of one.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia had just put his loincloth back on when he noticed a Guineafowl drinking from the other side of the river.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Hudin was still getting ready. Without thinking, Spia grabbed Hudin&rsquo;s slingshot and fired a rock at the bird.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He missed by several feet. It wasn&rsquo;t a surprise, considering he had no training with ranged weapons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;Give me that.&rdquo; Hudin scolded before grabbing her slingshot back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We should take the short way back." Dagut said as she grabbed the leftover soap. "I don't want to be late for sanctuary."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The short way home was a little less populated and a little more dangerous, but they'd be fine, given that they were a group of four.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh, that's a corpse." Raif announced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">With reluctant eyes, Spia followed Raif's finger to see the mangled dead body of a male. The body was clutching a chunk of bird meat, so it wasn't hard to figure out what had happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia was just thankful it was no one he knew.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Maybe he just killed himself." said Hudin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"That's dark." Dagut replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia touched his chin with thought. He supposed it was physically possible for someone to murder themself, but he'd never had the thought before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">It <em>was </em>a dark thought. He made a note to talk to his psychologist about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Another person has died eating alone." Raif said dryly. "If only this could have been avoided."</span></p>
<p>Spia felt his face turn white.</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Don't start." he snapped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"But--"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Don't start."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Both Hudin and Dagut looked uncomfortable by how heated things had gotten. With a sigh, Spia did his best to soften his face.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Ok, what's going on?" asked Tala.</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren looked back at her clipboard.</p>
<p>"Eating in front of others is thought to be shameful act that will lead to violence and cannibalism." she explained.</p>
<p>"That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard." Barton replied.</p>
<p>"Why do they think that?" Tex wondered.</p>
<p>Dr. Logren pulled a twenty-sided die out of her pocket. In a sweep of her hand, she rolled it across the ground.</p>
<p>"...Point taken." followed Tex.</p>
<p>Tex looked back at the screen. He was just thankful that modern humans weren't so militant about applying shame to such basic things.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Let's stop for a moment here." Raif said. "I have to pee."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">They made their way over to a tree. While Dagut and Hudin kept watch on either side of Raif, Spia made eye contact with Raif so he would feel safe while he urinated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Have you seen any cool bugs lately?" Spia asked, bored.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Ah!" Tex yelped.</p>
<p>"What?" Junji wondered.</p>
<p>"You're peeing!"</p>
<p>Junji rolled his eyes.</p>
<p><em>"Americans</em>." he huffed.</p>
<p>To Tex's surprise, he was the only one flipping out.</p>
<p>"I don't get why you think it's such a big deal." said Tala.</p>
<p>"The hell?" Tex spat. "How can y'all not think it's a big deal?"</p>
<p>"I mean, it's kind of weird, but only because we made it weird in the first place."</p>
<p>"It ain't <em>natural. </em>"</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hang on." Dagut said. "I need to take a dump."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Ahh!" Tex shouted, cursing himself for ever uncovering his eyes.</p>
<p>"Coward." Barton muttered.</p>
<p>"Skip it! Please!"</p>
<p><em>"Fine. </em>" Dr. Lofgren replied.</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren pressed her skip button for several seconds. When she released it, everyone was back in town.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">They made it back to their village with a few minutes to spare. Spia winced to see the main path was blocked by two strangers in the middle of an animated argument.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We should report the dead body." Dagut said quietly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I'll do it." Hudin replied. "He's my second cousin, so I know his family."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Hudin left their group, which meant there were even fewer people to separate Spia from the arguing pair.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"...how you can think that. </em>" the male finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"I can kill thirty birds with thirty rocks and hunt a boar better than you. </em>" the niht female replied. <em>"You think my body can't handle a baby?"</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">While the male's face twisted with anger, Raif began to sidestep away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I'll see you at sanctuary, Spia." Raif muttered as he left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"Traditions exist for a reason.</em>" the male spat at the female.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"And I suppose you think we should keep sacrificing lefties to the sun gods, do you?" </em>she replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Are you coming to sanctuary?" Dagut asked Spia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"In a few minutes." he replied. "I need to...do some stuff."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Dagut flicked her brow up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You know where the food is." she muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia turned his face away so she wouldn't see how red his face had gotten. He waited until no one he knew was around before grabbing some berries, roasted bird, and eggs from the food table and running off into the savanna. He found a spot behind a tree, with no one around for eight seventeenths of a kilometer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Discussions of eating tended to make everyone uncomfortable, but Spia knew he was a special case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">It had started with a fascination a few years after his subconscious had come to understand that it was a taboo. He wasn't sure if it was learned or if it was a pre-existing condition, but the thought of eating in front of another person got him off more than anything else he could think of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He'd never indulged himself in the thought, as he was too ashamed. But he knew it was there, just as he knew that he could never, ever, ever tell anyone. Because if he did, no one would love him anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He didn't think too hard about it. The thought only came up when he ate, and he always managed to push it down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia retreated to the outdoor auditorium where sanctuary was held once he&rsquo;d finished. Everyone had already started with the meditation session, so it was easy to sneak in and sit down in the spot Raif had saved for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The back of the auditorium had been painted with the phrase <em>It is unwise to love a man before there is hair on his chin.</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You may notice that you apply negative or positive value to each of your thoughts as you have them." said the female leading the meditation, a cchit elder. "Do your best to ignore these value placements, and simply observe each thought as an inherent neutrality."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia let his eyes fall closed out of habit. It wasn't hard for him to fall into a meditative state, even with the occasional sound of people breaking down sobbing as they confronted their inner demons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>'This sure makes my life better.</em>' Spia thought to himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The meditation session came to an end when the elder played a note from her flute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Thank you all for joining me today." she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"Thank you, Gengar!" </em>someone called.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Several people laughed. Gengar chuckled along with them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We gather today to discuss the teachings of Mu, the goddess of wisdom." followed Gengar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Gengar put her flute down before she continued. Spia felt a rush of anticipation, as learning new things always made him feel more whole.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Mu taught us of three spirits that make our world and all we can see." she explained.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"God, what&rsquo;s this crap?&rdquo; asked Barton.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"First, the spirit of length." Gengar continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Gengar touched the tips of her fingers together and moved them to either side of her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Then, the spirit of height."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Gengar touched her finger tips together once again, but this time, she moved them away from each other on a vertical axis.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"And finally, the spirit of width."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">After making her final finger touch, Gengar moved one finger behind herself and the other in front.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Oh, this is okay I guess." Barton mumbled.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia reached his hands out and examined them with new understanding. He'd learned of the three spirits from Hudin years before, but he was always happy to be reminded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Mu also taught that there might be other spirits, ones that we can't see with our limitations as creatures of only three spirits." Gengar explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia's head spun as he tried to imagine a world with a forth spirit. He could understand the general concept, but he found himself getting stuck trying to imagine what it might look like.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Never mind, I was right the first time." Barton followed.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">After their celebration of Mu came a debate of intelligent design versus non-intelligent design. They broke into two groups and took turns forming circles around each other, with the inner circle having the discussion and the outer circle observing.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"I thought fishbowl seminars were invented by the Greeks." said Tex.</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren replied by laughing so hard that she had to wipe her eyes.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...have to be a god." a male finished. "What else could have made us?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Even if we were made by a god, god had to have been created by something. And somewhere along that line, something had to have not been intelligent-design." Hudin argued.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Man, imagine if these people knew how to grow food." Tala said.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">After the debate, a male elder announced the names of the three adolescents who would be having their coming of age ceremony in just a few days. Spia applauded along with everyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Coming of age ceremonies happened for females at their first menstrual cycle, and for males at their first public erection. The ceremony consisted of being given a bunch of mushrooms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia was just about to reunite with his friends when he noticed a group of three cciht females, all giving him a side eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He turned to them to get a closer look. Two of the females met his gaze, but the one in the center dropped her eyes to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He recognized their faces, but he didn't know their names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Go." one of the females whispered to the one in the middle. "Ask him."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The middle female's attention stayed on the ground as she took a few steps towards him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hello." Spia greeted. "Can I help you with something?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Is this a bad time?" the female asked. "If this is a bad time, I won't bother you."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"No, this is fine."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh..."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The female looked like she'd been wishing it was a bad time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I want to have a baby." she said. "And I was hoping--you could father the child."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia raised both his eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Making a baby is a big responsibility." said Spia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I'm prepared."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You're prepared to take care of it for a full four years? That&rsquo;s a long time.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yes."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Having gotten all the information he needed, it wasn't hard for Spia to make his decision.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Alright, then." he replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Really?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Sure. Why not?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Thank you!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">She wasn't particularly attractive, but getting to put his penis into something that wasn't an asshole or actively bleeding was always nice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"No problem." Spia replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I start ovulating in three days."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;Sure. And call me when the baby's going to be born. I can be there with you, if you want."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s so kind. I&rsquo;m sure your energy will make a great half for our child.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>&ldquo;Hah, spiritual dumbasses don&rsquo;t know what genes are.&rdquo; Barton grunted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Do you know how genes work?&rdquo; Tala wondered.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ugh, what does it matter?&rdquo;</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The female retreated to her friends with a smile and a few tears of joy. Spia was always happy to be a father again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He found Hudin, Raif, and Dagut on the other side of the auditorium. It was getting dark, so Spia was glad he&rsquo;d eaten when he did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Where were you?" Hudin asked as they helped tidy the area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I'm going to be a dad." answered Spia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Who asked?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Don't know."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Was it a cchit?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia looked over at Hudin's face to see it was just as judgmental as her tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">let out a quick scoff.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You know what?" Spia replied. "I don't think that matters."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Really?" asked Hudin. "Because it does matter."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Why are you so hung up on this, anyway?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"It's just science. Are you denying that cciht women have wider hips? You can't deny that. It's their definitive feature."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"No, but--"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Some types of people are better at some things. Males are better at lifting things and identifying colors by sense of smell. Niht are better at acrobatics and using ranged weapons. Cchit are better at giving birth and making blood sacrifices. These are facts that science has proven."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I'm not disagreeing with that. I'm just saying, if niht wants to have a baby, and a cchit doesn't, what's the big deal? It's not like the world is going to end."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Cciht women can push out babies with low death rates. Niht women are actually going to die if they try to have kids. That's not fair to their babies."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia frowned. He understood that Hudin came from a family of traditionalists, but he didn't understand why she always had to be so conservative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Raif, back me up here." he pleaded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"No." Raif replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Alright."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Let's say <em>you </em>wanted to have a baby." Hudin continued as she pointed at Spia. "Should you get to have one just because you want to? Do you want to push a baby out your dick hole, Spia?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Whatever reply Spia was planning on making was interrupted when another group of people approached them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hello!" the male in the lead greeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia bent his right arm, extended his left, and dipped his head into his bent arm. The newcomers returned the greeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Did you want to ask us something?" he wondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yeah, actually." a male replied. "We're having a sex pit next to the artifact hut, and we were wondering if any of you want to join."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I could go for a sex pit."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Me too." said Hudin. "Although I'm ovulating, so I can only do anal."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"God, that's so relatable." Tala muttered.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"That's fine." the man replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh, but I don't have a towel. I should get some first."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I'll go with you." Dagut said to Hudin. "I want to grab some water."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia's group was halved as Dagut and Hudin left for the fabric weavers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Hudin was always excited to join a sex pit. So was Spia, but like all males, his lust could never match that of a female's.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">One of the other members of the new group drifted her eyes towards Raif.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Are you bringing...him?" she asked Spia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yes, I am." Spia replied with an irritated flick of his eyebrows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Well, at least he's handsome."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The group took off towards the artifact hut. Spia turned to Raif instead of following them right away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Are you up for a sex pit?" he asked Raif.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I don't feel welcome." Raif muttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hudin and I can get you in a four-way."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...Fine."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">They began to make their way over to the artifact hut. It wasn't a long walk, but it was long enough for Spia to start up a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"How come you didn't support me back there?" Spia wondered as he grabbed Raif&rsquo;s hand and fitted it in his own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"About pregnancy rights?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yeah."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Because you two are both equally ridiculous."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia looked over at Raif's face to see no indication that he was joking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We all argue day in and out over if niht should have children and if cchit should be able to opt out," Raif continued, "but no one ever seems to consider that these are categories we've manufactured."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia couldn't believe what he was hearing. Everyone knew that there were three squibders. Just like everyone knew that hitting children wasn't worth its effectiveness as a short-term solution because it made for emotionally-unstable adults, and that it took twenty-four hours for the sun to go around the earth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You can't just say something like that." Spia replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I can say whatever I want."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Okay, but you can't say something like that without backing it up."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Raif let out a sigh of comical exasperation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Some females have bigger hips than others." Spia followed. "Half of females weigh more than 69.69 kilograms, and half weigh less. How can you argue with that?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We will say there is a spectrum of females from heaviest to lightest." Raif replied. "And on another axis, a spectrum of how much they want a baby, and then a third axis for a spectrum of how well they could deliver said baby. No matter what correlations you might find, there are no definitive lines to draw."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yes there is. In the middle."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Why not in thirds?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia blinked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Why don't we divide males on either side of 84.20 kilograms?" followed Raif.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">At first, Spia found himself unable to think of a response. But then, an argument that had originally been Raif&rsquo;s came to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I get what you're saying." Spia said slowly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"But?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"But we're natural. So even if we make something, isn't that thing still natural?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Raif rubbed his chin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"That's a good argument..." he muttered.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"No it&rsquo;s not." said Junji.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Arguing with Raif was one of Spia's favorite activities. The only thing he might have enjoyed more was sleeping, as it meant he got to wake up to another day of living in a group of people willingly supporting one another with their work and helping each other to create a better community and having a political system simple enough that he could understand and observe its inner-workings, as was the human condition.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">They arrived at the artifact hut in less than a minute. But to Spia's surprise, there was no orgy in sight. Instead, a group of seven spoke to each other in hushed voices.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Something's wrong." Raif whispered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia walked with Raif to the group. They all looked over when Spia cleared his throat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What's going on?" he wondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Out of the seven people, Spia knew most of them, but not by name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Someone died." a niht female explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What happened?" asked Spia.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Apparently they got mauled while they were eating dinner."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Are you talking about the male who we found? Hudin's cousin?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"No, this one was a female."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oof, that's two in one day."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia felt Raif tense beside him. In horror, Spia looked at Raif's face to see the expression of a man who'd received his final straw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"So, are we overturning this regulation?" Raif asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Independently of each other, each group member turned their eyes towards Raif.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Excuse me?" the female replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Raif, don't do this." Spia pleaded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Half of our dead were killed while eating." Raif continued. "We are humans, we are not meant to do things alone."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">One of the males burst into tears.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"God, these people cry a lot." said Barton.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"She was my sister." the male replied through his tears. "How dare you turn this into an outlet for your--cannibalistic cause."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What does anything I'm saying have to do with violence? How brainwashed are you that you see a connection?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia had known Raif his whole life. He&rsquo;d never seen Raif so angry.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Stop." Spia pushed. "Please."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">One of the males lifted a sharp rock from the ground. Spia felt the color drain from his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Don't hurt him." Spia followed. "You don't understand him."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">A female reached for her slingshot and another male grabbed his spear from his back. Spia hadn't seen such a look in a group of people's eyes in decades, but he still managed to recognize it meant someone had to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You know, I think you've been a nuisance to us for long enough." the male with the rock said. "I can handle transgression, but not when it's at the cost of humanity."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Castrate him." one of the others suggested.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"He doesn't deserve it. I'm going to kill him."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You can do two things."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Damn, humans used to be so violent." said Tala. "Now we just retweet lies about people on Twitter until they want to kill themselves."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You're insane!" Spia shouted. "You don't need to do this."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia hadn't realized it, but he and Raif were slowly being backed into the side of the artifact hut. As soon as Spia's back hit the wall, a spear was shoved in his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Are you really going to defend a predator?" the male with a spear asked him. "Do the right thing and stand down."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">It was a horrible choice to make, between the two of them both meeting their fate or just one of them. But in the end, it was the thought of defending something that made him so ashamed that caused Spia to let go of Raif's hand and step away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"That's fine." Raif spat. "I'll do it without you."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>It was at that moment that Tex finally understood why there had been a red dot and bad reviews in Dr. Lofgren's theater.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You're not going to be doing much--"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The second before Spia could even close his eyes, a small pebble sailed through the air and hit the male with the spear in the forehead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">His brow tensed with confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...Huh?" he asked as he looked up at the empty sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh, sorry." said a familiar voice. "Were you busy?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia looked over his shoulder to see Dagut walking towards them with a dead eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">At the sight of an elder, everyone disengaged their weapons.</span></p>
<p>"<span style="font-family: courier;">Yeah, we were." the male replied. "We have a guy here wondering why we shouldn't just kill each other for food."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You mean the eating thing?" asked Dagut. "Please. You don't know this man at all."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Are you <em>defending </em>him?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"At least he's speaking for what he believes in."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What's that supposed to mean?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Someone has to go, so you snap at the first person who steps out of line. I get it. You're like teenagers, purging whoever you can to make sure it isn&rsquo;t you."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The male who'd picked up a rock tossed it back on the ground, harder than he needed to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What do you suggest we do with him?" the female with the slingshot asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We answer his questions." Dagut replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The group looked stunned, but they still complied when Dagut maneuvered them into a semi-circle and had them all sit down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Weapons over there." she ordered. "Thank you."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Everyone left their weapons in a little pile. Spia sat down too, although it was more because he no longer felt able to support himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What would you like to ask me?" Dagut said to Raif.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Raif glanced at each member of the group who'd tried to kill him before looking back at Dagut.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I don't understand why we torture ourselves like this, and why we continue to do so when it brings about so much death." he answered, the words slow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We understand that people die. But we believe that when an action brings about more good than bad, that action is justified. We consider the prevention of perverted cultures to be of more good than the death toll is bad."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I suppose that makes sense. But I simply can't comprehend why we believe public eating will lead to perversion."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"For the same reason we believe walking leads to moving.&rdquo; the female who&rsquo;d had a slingshot spat. &ldquo;What kind of response is that?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Dagut put her hand up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;Our ancient legends tell of several societies where public eating was not only encouraged, but mandatory." she explained.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What of it?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"In these societies, it was acceptable to cannibalize children in an attempt to add their energy to your &lsquo;life force&rsquo;.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Raif opened his mouth but quickly closed it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Public eating was already considered mildly rude in our culture, and we had no cannibalism." Dagut continued. "That's how we made the connection, and why we started to increase social pressure."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;Couldn&rsquo;t that just be a coincidence?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"It could be. But we haven't done it in front of each other for thousands of years, and have no idea what will happen."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;What if we did a trial?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;Are you willing to take that risk?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Their conversation continued, but Spia found himself too ashamed to pay attention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He didn't realize he'd snapped into a trance until everyone was gone but Raif, who was standing over him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...hear me?" Raif finished.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I'm sorry." Spia said immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Out of all the emotions Spia was expecting to see in Raif's eyes, surprise was low on the list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"It's alright." Raif replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"It's really not."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"But it is. I wouldn't ask you to sacrifice yourself just so we could both die."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia wiped his face of tears he hadn't even noticed were there. He had no desire to explain to Raif that it was more complicated on his end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He also couldn't help but feel that Raif might have been angrier if he'd had a higher opinion of himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I need to go on a walk." he said as he stood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Please come back soon. I don't want to sleep alone."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia mumbled in agreement as he got up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He didn't stop walking until he was a good ways out of the village. With every step, he wondered how he was supposed to live with himself after--</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Spia turned his head towards a rustling in the grass next to him. It was dark, but he could still make out the giant spotted cat as it lunged towards him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh, sp--" he managed.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>The simulation ended.</p>
<p>"Wow." Barton said with a nod. "I can't believe I could've sucked so much."</p>
<p>"Would you like to see another simulation?" asked Dr. Lofgren.</p>
<p>"Uh, um." Tex stammered.</p>
<p>"I mean, what else are we going to do?" Tala replied.</p>
<p>"I would be interested." Junji stated.</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren clicked a button on her remote. The savanna was replaced by a more puritanical setting before Tex could even begin to process what had just happened.</p>
<p>"Medieval people are just as dumb as hunter gatherers," Dr Lofgren explained, "except their knowledge is destroyed by random king every two hundred years and they live under circumstances they were not evolved for."</p>
<p>The focus was still on the four of them. Besides their new clothing, their complexions had lightened significantly. And although their faces were still recognizable, their features had been shifted into something more northern European.</p>
<p>They appeared to be stoning an unwed pregnant woman. Tex might have noticed, had he not mentally checked himself out.</p>
<p>"Ha, olden times people were so stupid." Barton laughed as she pointed her finger.</p>
<p>"Just olden times people, huh?" asked Tala.</p>
<p>"Yeah. People were all batshit until about sixty years ago. Now they're alright."</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren pressed a button on her remote. The screen shifted to show a scene of a modern protest.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;What do you mean when you say war is gay?&rdquo; the interviewer asked twentieth century Barton at the protest rally.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;I mean war&rsquo;s fucking gay." twentieth century Barton replied. "What else would it mean?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Lame." said Barton.</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren pressed another button.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;So you&rsquo;re in support of Eugenics, because you believe that Kyrgyz people are the most superior race?&rdquo; Joe Rogan asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; replied Junji.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s a...unique choice.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"I've always wanted to meet with the great negotiator." Junji muttered fondly.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hitler brings up some good points, actually. I do need someone to blame for our economy." German Tala noted to her friend.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>&ldquo;This isn&rsquo;t so bad.&rdquo; Tala shrugged.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; her friend asked. &ldquo;Sorry, I&rsquo;m on the phone.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;God, you and phones.&rdquo; Tala replied with a scoff. &ldquo;Remember when we used to talk face to face?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>While Tala screamed, Dr. Lofgren changed the scene once again.</p>
<p>&ldquo;You know, watching Dallas kill a Japanese version of himself in World War II brings up a good point.&rdquo; said Barton. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m not sure what it is, but it&rsquo;s there.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Junji turned to Dr. Lofgren.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I must ask.&rdquo; he said to her. &ldquo;Which one of us has owned the most slaves?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dr. Lofgren pressed a button that displayed what looked like statistics across the screen, although they were all in Swedish.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I would have to run more simulations for better answer,&rdquo; she started, &ldquo;but so far, Ms. Locklear has--&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m number one!&rdquo; Tala shouted.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Good for you.&rdquo; Barton replied.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Are you proud of me Tex?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tex said nothing.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Tex?&rdquo; followed Tala.</p>
<p>&ldquo;W--huh?&rdquo; Tex asked.</p>
<p>Tex looked over to see that Tala was eyeing him with expectation.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up your ass?&rdquo; Barton wondered. &ldquo;You haven&rsquo;t said a word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"I'm gonna--go to the bathroom." Tex replied before immediately taking off too quickly to gauge anyone's reaction.</p>
<p>The bathrooms weren't hard to find. Instead of going in, Tex sat down on the floor and put his back to the wall.</p>
<p>The bizarre ideologies of the people in the simulation had been nothing to compare to the way Tex felt about witnessing his own personal failings. He sat in a trance of disbelief for about five minutes before a pair of shoes pattering against the floor made him look up.</p>
<p>It was Junji. Tex looked at his shoes.</p>
<p>"Are you alright?" asked Junji.</p>
<p>When Tex replied, he found he was only able to speak through his teeth.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not alright." Tex answered.</p>
<p>"What's wrong?"</p>
<p>"What's wrong? I betrayed you is what's wrong."</p>
<p>Junji seemed surprised by the intensity of Tex's response.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Which time?&rdquo; Junji asked.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Huh?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time in Berlin? Or the time in--&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;The time we were cavemen.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Junji&rsquo;s formed into an &lsquo;oh&rsquo; shape.</p>
<p>"I did not interpret it that way." Junji stated.</p>
<p>"Yeah, I got that from the...other you."</p>
<p>"No, I meant that I did not interpret those people as us."</p>
<p>Tex finally managed to look Junji in the eyes, but not for long.</p>
<p>"...You didn't?" he asked.</p>
<p>"That man had a different upbringing than you. Vastly different ideologies."</p>
<p>"He had my blood. That's what matters."</p>
<p>"If you are truly going to stick by that opinion, you might have committed every sin imaginable in that machine."</p>
<p>Tex stared.</p>
<p>"And so might have I." followed Junji.</p>
<p>"I just--I don't feel good about this."</p>
<p>Junji sighed.</p>
<p>"I am going to come over the next night we both have off, and we are going to watch a movie." he said. "I do not, nor will I ever, think less of you because of what I saw today."</p>
<p>Tex said nothing. Junji gave him one last look before retreating back to the others.</p>
<p>All things considered, Junji had made some good arguments. Still, Tex liked himself just a little less from that day forth.</p>
