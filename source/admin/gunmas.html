</br><p><p>"Lookit this picture of my mama." Tex ordered with a wave of his wallet.</p>
<p>"That is a Q-tip." Junji replied.</p>
<p>Tex looked down at his hand to see he was holding a Q-tip.</p>
<p>"Hang on, I keep it in one of the back pockets under the Safeway card." Tex said as he tried to open the Q-tip.</p>
<p>"How much pain killer were you given?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Just an hour prior, Junji had taken Tex to a surprisingly professional black market operating room, where he'd had a tiny box installed in his brain stem that upon being fed a proper series of thought commands would activate a laser grid which would reduce him to cubic millimeters in less than a second.</p>
<p>He'd also been given copious amounts of anesthesia.</p>
<p>"Give me your keys." Junji stated.</p>
<p>Tex examined his surroundings to see they were at his front door. He pulled his keys out of his pocket and handed them to Junji.</p>
<p>"This is a firearm." followed Junji.</p>
<p>"It's the key to my heart, baby."</p>
<p>"And I'm keeping it."</p>
<p>"No!"</p>
<p>"Give me your keys."</p>
<p>Tex scowled and handed Junji his keys.</p>
<p>"This is another Q-tip." Junji said.</p>
<p>Tex removed his pants and handed them to Junji. Junji fished the keys from the front pocket before giving the pants back to Tex.</p>
<p>"Why'd you give me these?" Tex asked as he examined the unfamiliar pair of jeans.</p>
<p>Tex was promptly pulled inside his apartment when his door was opened. While Junji shut the door and locked it, Tex took it upon himself to lie face down on the floor and hug the carpet.</p>
<p><em>"Mama.</em>" he muttered.</p>
<p>"Do you have any other weapons in your apartment?"</p>
<p>"......No."</p>
<p>Tex felt a weight drop on his back. He turned over to discover Junji had tossed his jeans towards him.</p>
<p>In an attempt to put his pants back on, Tex wound up with a pant leg wrapped around his neck.</p>
<p>"I have decided I don't trust you alone with yourself." said Junji.</p>
<p>"Gimme my gun back."</p>
<p>"It will be returned when you are no longer inebriated."</p>
<p>Tex turned back into the floor and frowned. He didn't like the feeling of being so far away from his gun, especially on Christmas.</p>
<p>Christmas!</p>
<p>Tex's eyes snapped open with a sudden idea, allowing him to get a close look at the fibers of his carpet.</p>
<p>"Juji." Tex said to the ground.</p>
<p>"That is not my name."</p>
<p>"If you're gonna take my gun, you gotta do something for me."</p>
<p>"What do you need?"</p>
<p>"Read me a story."</p>
<p>Junji sighed.</p>
<p>"What story?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Go to my bed. There's a lockbox under my mattress. Use the keys to open it."</p>
<p>Junji didn't seem happy about what he was being requested to do, but he did it anyway. About half a minute after Junji's feet had disappeared, Tex heard a clicking sound from the direction of his bed.</p>
<p>"I&rsquo;ve found a stack of papers." Junji said as he came back. &ldquo;You seem to have written on them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>"Listen to my tale."</p>
<p>"They say 'DO NOT READ' on the front. Are you sure you're comfortable with me reading this?"</p>
<p>"It's fine."</p>
<p>"I am not sure if <em>I'm</em> comfortable."</p>
<p>Tex frowned.</p>
<p>"But it's Christmas." he pleaded.</p>
<p>"It's April."</p>
<p>"What else are we gonna do?"</p>
<p>"...That's a good point."</p>
<p>Tex could hear a shuffling sound as Junji sat down on the couch and started to sift through papers.</p>
<p><em>"How the Grinch Stole Gunmas.</em>" Junji read. "You wrote a Christmas story in April?"</p>
<p>"I wrote it in March."</p>
<p>While Tex gave the carpet a loving nuzzle with his cheek, Junji cleared his throat and began to read.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Dallas Porteme&ntilde;e Tex knew something was wrong from the second he'd woken up.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>Junji stopped reading after a mere one sentence.</p>
<p>"We need to talk about your name." said Junji.</p>
<p>"No." Tex replied with a frown.</p>
<p>"So your mother's surname was Porteme&ntilde;e, which is your middle name, and then you changed your nickname to your last name."</p>
<p>"I guess."</p>
<p>"What was your father's last name?"</p>
<p>"Fortworth."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">It didn't take him long to figure out what it was, either. Something was off about his pillow. After giving his eyes a quick rub, he lifted it to see that his handgun was gone.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Ahh!" Tex yelped.</p>
<p>Junji stopped reading.</p>
<p>"Sorry, got scared." Tex followed. "Keep going."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Panic began to set in for Dallas as he thought about the night before. He had a clear memory of putting his gun away, which made him only assume the worst.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He searched his apartment twice. Nothing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><span style="color: rgba(121, 178, 109, 1);"><strong>From Supreme Jackass</strong><br />anybody seen my gun?</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgb(160, 160, 160);"><strong>To Garbage Band</strong><br />you too?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><span style="color: rgba(121, 178, 109, 1);"><strong>From Supreme Jackass</strong><br />what do you mean</span></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgba(230, 126, 35, 1);"><strong>From Gamer Gril</strong><br />you two obviously ain't seen the news</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgb(160, 160, 160);"><strong>To Garbage Band</strong><br />what news?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgba(230, 126, 35, 1);"><strong>From Gamer Gril</strong><br />every gun in Seattle just disappeared</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgb(160, 160, 160);"><strong>To Garbage Band</strong><br />hell they go?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgba(230, 126, 35, 1);"><strong>From Gamer Gril</strong><br />they fizzled out of existence</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgba(230, 126, 35, 1);"><strong>From Gamer Gril</strong><br />it's a christmas miracle</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgb(160, 160, 160);"><strong>To Garbage Band</strong><br />more like christmas fearicle</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Why'd you stop?" asked Tex.</p>
<p>"I wanted to inform you that your joke was physically painful for me to read."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><span style="color: rgba(39, 208, 227, 1);"><strong>From Spoodge King</strong><br />I would like to inform you that your joke was physically painful for me to read.</span></span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Damn it." Junji followed.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Dallas darted his eyes around his apartment. For the first time in years, he no longer felt safe in his place of residence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgb(160, 160, 160);"><strong>To Garbage Band</strong><br />this might be a little problematic for us</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgb(160, 160, 160);"><strong>To Garbage Band</strong><br />we gotta figure something out</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgba(230, 126, 35, 1);"><strong>From Gamer Gril</strong><br />let's not talk about it here</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgba(230, 126, 35, 1);"><strong>From Gamer Gril</strong><br />how does eleven sound?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">They ended up agreeing on eleven, which gave Dallas enough time to catch a bit of the news as he made his way out the door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"...all guns within the city limits have vanished,</em>" one news anchor said to the other, <em>"and reports popping up from King County show that any attempts to pass firearms into the city limits have resulted in the immediate disintegration of said firearms.</em>"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"It's a Christmas miracle, huh?"</em> the other replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"Sure is. Seems that through the power of wishing, locals have managed to alter the laws of physics.</em>"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"Guess murder's just over now for them, huh.</em>"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"Yup. Reckon the rest of the country could follow in their footsteps, if they got the will. We could be a gun free nation by sundown.</em>"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Dallas shivered at the thought. He grabbed a pocket knife before he left. Although Junji wasn't waiting for him at the bottom, Tex decided to run to work anyway and even made it up the staircase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He opened the door to see Tala and Barton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hey look everyone, it's Tex and his normal sized ass!" Tala greeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You're late." Barton grunted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Sorry." Dallas replied. "Got distracted by the news."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Atop Tala's lap was a stuffed Barney the Dinosaur toy. Dallas hadn't noticed it when he'd come in, but he could no longer stop noticing it after seeing it once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hell'd you get that thing?" he asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"My weird uncle Elan gave me it for Christmas." Tala replied. &ldquo;I don't really know what to do with it."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Dallas had never met any of Tala's family, but he'd always been curious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What're we supposed to be talking about?" followed Tala.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"How to kill people without guns." Barton answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Considering the fact that they'd broken a neck, punched someone to death, and almost used a lethal injection all since Junji had joined, Dallas wasn't too worried about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We got options." he replied. "Harder options, but they're there."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I'm more worried about the country." said Barton. "Last time the hippies got their way, they had a concert so big you had to shit in the woods and then they bragged about it for a hundred years."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tala scoffed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Y'all talk and talk about how the government is gonna walk all over us if we don't got guns." she replied. "But you know what else might not happen? Public shootings, police brutalities--"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton snored. Dallas looked over to see that she'd fallen asleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Barton, quick!" he said as he shook her awake. "The Chinese are coming up the stairs!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hwaa--ahh!" Barton yelped as she pulled up her shirt and reached into her shoulder hole, only to realize there wasn't a gun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Dallas watched as panic grew in Barton's eyes before quickly turning into irritation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Don't do that." Barton said as she kicked Tex's foot.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Wait." Junji muttered as his reading came to a halt.</p>
<p>"What?" asked Tex.</p>
<p>"Why did you change your name to Tex? You called yourself Dallas before."</p>
<p>"I started writing this thinking I was just gonna call myself Dallas, cause it sounded all proper and such, but then I realized it ended with an 's'."</p>
<p>"Why does that matter?"</p>
<p>"Cause if you're doing a possession of a name that ends with an 's', you gotta put the little thing at the end of the name instead of doing it and then the 's'. Didn&rsquo;t like the way it looked."</p>
<p>"What a reason."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">There was a little jostle as the door knob started to move. A moment later, the door opened to reveal Junji.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Ahh!" Barton and Tex both yelped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hello." Junji greeted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton breathed out a sigh of relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh thank god." she muttered. "It's just the Japanese."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Junji took a seat at the table next to Tex and put his feet up in Tex&rsquo;s lap. Tex promptly removed them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You hear the news, Junji?" said Tex. "We ain't allowed to use guns no more."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yes." Junji replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You sure?" Tala asked Junji. "Reckoned you'd look a little more down about it."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Does everyone talk like this in your mind?" Junji wondered.</p>
<p>"Talk like what?"</p>
<p>"Never mind."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I am a spectacle of both a physical and meta-physical nature. I've no need for such a primitive technology as firearms to commiteth thine homicides."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Kutabare." Junji swore.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"He's full of shit." Barton replied. "Gun beats Bruce Lee every time."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Where'd you learn that?" asked Tex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We watched one of them Kung-Fu movies in college."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You went to college?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yeah, I got a degree in the History of Wars Between September 1st, 1939 and September 2nd, 1945."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What did you study, Tex?" Tala asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Uh, huh." Tex stammered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"He studied how to suck penis at the university of dropping out of high school." answered Barton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Why&rsquo;d you drop out of high school?" Tala pushed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Cause it was stupid." Tex replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"That's a good point, actually."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">As Tala turned back to Junji, Tex thought back to all the times his teachers had called him stupid for his poor performance in school. They were right that he had been and still was a moron, but on the bright side, most of them were dead.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Do you actually believe that?" Junji asked.</p>
<p>"That it's good my teachers died? No, I was just being funny."</p>
<p>"That was not what I was referring to."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What about you, Junji?" Tala wondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I double majored in Theoretical Physics and Quantum Mechanics." Junji answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton gagged.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What?" asked Junji.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What'd you minor in, Dead Languages?" Barton replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"No, I was too busy working for my mother for a minor."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"This is accurate." Junji said. "Both my majors and working for my mother."</p>
<p>"Course it is. I listen when you talk."</p>
<p>Junji didn't reply, but he didn't start reading again, either.</p>
<p>"Something wrong?" Tex asked.</p>
<p>"What's my last name?"</p>
<p>"...Huh?"</p>
<p>"What's my last name, Dallas?"</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What are you supposed to do with a quantum mechanics degree?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Understand quantum mechanics."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"And what are you supposed to do with that?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Understand."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton scoffed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"If you can name one relevant thing you learned in Chakra class," she started, "I'll pee in Tex's mouth."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Huh?" asked Tex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Junji poked himself in the chin with an expression of thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I would like to talk about subatomic particle movements." he said slowly. &ldquo;Does anyone have a sheet of paper I could use?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I do!" Tala replied immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tala handed Junji a piece of paper and a pouch of colored pencils from her bag. Junji turned the paper to landscape before he got to drawing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">It looked like he was making a tic-tac-toe grid.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"If we were to continuously zoom in on reality," Junji began, "we would eventually reach a group of the smallest particles in the universe. Here, I have drawn a diagram."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex looked over to examine Junji's drawing in the top corner.</span></p>
<div>
<p><img src="/pics/multi 1.png" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"This black dot is the particle whose movement we will be observing." followed Junji.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"This is a good way to explain this concept." Junji said. "Why do you know about this?"</p>
<p>"You got drunk and yelled it at me."</p>
<p>"...My apologies."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What are the blue particles?" Barton asked, to Tex's surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Assume that they are undergoing the same process as our main particle, but we won't be studying them."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Junji drew a second diagram to the right of the first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"The particle is going to move to one of the squares next to it." he explained as he showed Barton the drawing.</span></p>
<p><img src="/pics/multi 2.png"/></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"The green spaces represent possible paths the particle can take, and the numbers--"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Represent the probability of it taking that path." Barton cut in. "Yeah, I get it."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Why is this relevant?" Junji wondered.</p>
<p>"For a joke at the end. Keep reading."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"But even with these probabilities, the path it takes will still be dictated by complete and utter randomness. This is where multiverse theory comes in."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...Okay."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"The particle has a sixty percent chance of going this way, directly to the right. This means it will go that way across sixty percent of universes. Here, let's say we have five universes."</span></p>
<p><img src="/pics/multiverse theory.png" /></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"If some of the particles move a certain way, it may affect something that may affect something that may affect your brain chemistry or the physics of a situation differently than if the particles had moved a different way."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton chewed on her lower lip as she examined the diagram.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Does that make sense?" Junji followed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yup.&rdquo; answered Barton. &ldquo;Everything that can happen does happen but some things are more likely to can happen than others."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh. Yes, that is it."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton's face shone with understanding as she examined the diagram. Junji's face shone with pride as he examined Barton's face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Well, this was a waste of time." Barton said as she reached into her pocket and pulled out a pen-like device.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What are you doing?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Freeing up space."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton brought the pen to the memory-remover plate in the back of her neck. A moment later, her face turned blank.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Huh, what's going on?" she asked Junji.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I explained quantum randomness to you and then you wiped your memory."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh. Good for me."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton didn't seem to understand why Junji looked so exasperated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What?" she wondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"How could you do that?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I don't like learning things that don't matter."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"How does that not matter?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"How does it matter?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Junji&rsquo;s expression contorted from desperation to determination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Do you not care about the truth?" he asked. "Does learning the philosophies followed by the reality that makes us and everything else not seem important to you?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton snored.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Barton, wake up!" Tex said as he shook her awake. "The Chinese are at the door!"</span></p>
<p>"<span style="font-family: courier;">Hwaa--ahh!" Barton yelped.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Once she&rsquo;d woken up again, Barton realized right away that there wasn't a threat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"That's it, I don't feel safe without a weapon." Barton announced while she took a stand. "I'll see you ladies next time someone decides to torture a robot.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">As Barton made her way out of sight, Tex realized he didn't feel safe, either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Think she&rsquo;s got a point." said Tex. "Catch you on the flip flop.&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex got out of his chair and left the room, narrowly avoiding the smack Junji attempted to land on his butt.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>Junji stopped reading with a tiny scoff.</p>
<p>"Why do you write me this way?" he asked.</p>
<p>"Hmm?"</p>
<p>"When have I ever touched you like this?"</p>
<p>"You're real handsy."</p>
<p>Junji let out a noise of exasperation but continued.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The stress of losing his gun started to sink in full force for Tex as he jogged back to his apartment. The closer he got, the more he was looking forward to seeing his wife of ten years. She always knew how to make him feel better.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"You did not mention you had a wife at the start." Junji said.</p>
<p>"I got lonely."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">He opened the front door of his apartment to see her sitting on the couch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hey there." Tex greeted. "How was work?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Terrible." she replied. &ldquo;How am I supposed to teach preschool without a gun?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"God, that's such a good point."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">As he spoke, Tex took a seat on the couch next to his wife. He put his arm around her when she laid her head down on his shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I just hope we don't go country wide with the Christmas wish." said Tex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Southern states would never go for it."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Don&rsquo;t matter what seventy percent of thirty percent of states want for themselves. It only matters what fifty-one percent of the country wants for everyone."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Is that what democracy is?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Unclear."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">As Tex's unnamed wife sunk farther into his shoulder, Tex wondered if maybe Christmas wouldn't be so bad after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Thought you'd be more uppity about losing your baby." she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex frowned to remember his gun and all the good times he'd had sneaking it through the TSA and killing people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Well, least I still got my other baby." he replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You're sweet, cowboy. Tell me. There anything I can do to make you feel better?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...Reckon there might be."</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Why'd you stop?" Tex asked.</p>
<p>"This is a graphic sex scene."</p>
<p>"Mhm."</p>
<p>"Is there a reason you've chosen to continuously clarify that the sex is not anal?"</p>
<p>Not for the first time, Tex was hit with the suspicion that Junji hadn't been raised Catholic.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">After waking from his immediate post-orgasm nap, Tex tinkered around in the garage that he also had until nightfall. He slept long and soundly, but the sex he'd gotten the night before had been so great that he woke up still feeling a little frazzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">To compensate, he left for a nearby coffee shop after kissing his wife goodbye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">There was snow on the ground and Christmas lights lined all the stores. Tex tried and failed to feel any Christmas spirit. Not wanting to support Starbucks, he ventured into a local business to discover they'd been bought by Starbucks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex sighed and got in line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Dallas?" a familiar voice asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex blinked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Barton?" he replied. "What're you doing here?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I'm getting coffee, asshole."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">A middle-aged woman in line before Barton turned around to face her. Tex could see that she had a small child next to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Excuse me, sir?" the woman spat at Barton. "Could you please not use that kind of language around my son?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Grow up, Billy." Barton said to her son.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The mother of the child said something back to Barton, and then Barton said something back to her, but Tex found himself distracted by a new figure who entered the coffee shop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">It was a man, maybe in his late twenties. His appearance was unkempt from his ratty shoes to his messy hair, and although it was winter, the long trench coat he was wearing seemed a bit out of place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...don't care how many Nazis you've beaten to death with your bare hands." the mother told Barton. "That doesn't give you the right to--"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"HANDS UP!" a voice shouted, bringing everyone's personal conversations to an immediate halt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex didn&rsquo;t even have to turn his head to know that the voice belonged to the man in the coat. When he looked over, he saw that the man&rsquo;s coat was now open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Clear bags of different substances lined the inside of the fabric, and the scent of fertilizer and propane filled the air. Tex distantly recognized the scent from nearly twenty years prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex tried to grab at his pocket, but was knocked over on top of Barton when the other patrons started to push and shove with panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Calm down!" the man yelled. "The suicide bombing will be over faster if everybody behaves!"</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Are you allowed to make jokes on this subject?" asked Junji.</p>
<p>"Who's gonna get offended? It's not like any real suicide bombers are going to read this."</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex managed to get onto his feet only to find that the bomber man's attention was on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You there!" the bomber shouted. "You are about to die in the name of religion or social commentary or whatever!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">With the man's focus elsewhere, the woman with the child reached into her purse and pulled out a taser pulse. Tex watched from the corner of his eye as she fired it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The taser hit the man in the leg.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Good thing I wore clothes today." he said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">While the bomber brought a lighter out, the barista lifted a can of mace. Tex barely had time to cover his eyes when the barista sprayed a cloud of pepper in the direction of the bomber.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The can proved itself capable of being able to fire from the range of about a dozen feet, with the mace coating the man's face, but all he did was howl in pain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex covered his mouth and coughed, but he only ended up sucking in more pepper-tainted air in the process. He did his best not to let it cloud his thinking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I got the will to murder twelve strangers." the bomber shouted as Tex finally managed to reach into his pocket and find the altered metal tube he&rsquo;d been looking for. &ldquo;You really think I give a damn about some piss in my eyes?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Language!" the mother yelped as she put her hands over her son's ears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">As the bomber lit the lighter, Tex extended his hand in a wink and aimed his shot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">There was a loud, noise-protectionless bang as Tex pulled the trigger on the metal tube and fired a gumball-shaped hunk of lead into the center of the target's body. For a second, the scent of methodically measured mixture of charcoal, Sulphur, and saltpeter overpowered the smell of pepper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex lowered the end of the metal rod in his hand with care, only to flinch when six more shots rang out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The bomber was no longer moving. Tex looked over at Barton to see that she also had something gun-shaped in her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Homemade hand cannon?" Barton asked him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Made it last night." Tex replied. "What'd you do?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"3D printer."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"What about the bullets?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hand loaded."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The panic of the coffee shop inhabitants turned into triumphant shouts as people realized they were going to live to see Christmas. Tex would have liked to've joined them, but Barton didn't seem particularly interested in staying.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"Is <em>to've</em> a proper contraction?" asked Junji.</p>
<p>"Who gives a shit?"</p>
<p>"Harvard."</p>
<p>"So no one important."</p>
<p>Junji let out a short laugh.</p>
<p>"I enjoy our friendship." he replied.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We're saved!" Billy shouted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh, how foolish we were to make a gun ban through the power of Christmas wishing." his mother said to the sky. "I hope that Jesus will find it in his heart to reverse the damage us city folk have done with our rash thinking and cold nature and individualistic culture and the way we always give anyone the stink eye if they try to start up a conversation with us while we're both waiting for the elevator."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The second he'd hopped over the dead body and made his way out the door, Tex was pulled aside with all the other witnesses by a team of paramedics. And by the time they'd finished explaining the situation to the paramedics, a news team had arrived and manhandled Tex into giving an interview alongside Barton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">&ldquo;Well, we don&rsquo;t usually report on terrorist attacks where the terrorist was taken down by a gun,&rdquo; the interviewer explained, &ldquo;but this seems to be a special case. Why don&rsquo;t you tell me what happened?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"That is a bold claim." said Junji.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The interviewer was a large, jolly man with a red suit, a big white beard, and a loaded bazooka strapped to his back. Tex felt he somehow looked familiar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"...shot him six times in the chest." Barton finished. "It was a lot like this time back in Civil War II when--"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"And there you have it, folks." the man interrupted, shooting a wink into the camera. "Be careful what you wish for."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex watched as the man took the bazooka off his back and fired it into the air. But instead of a missile, red and green glitter began to rain from the sky.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">A weight dropped into Tex&rsquo;s pocket. He touched the outside of his pants to feel the unmistakable shape of his old gun.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Thank you, sir!" Tex said to the man. "I don't know how you did it, but you did it well."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Of course, little boy." the man replied. "And you know what? I might have one more surprise for you."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex felt a vibration against his leg as his phone started to ring. He pulled it out to see it was from his wife.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"Honey, I'm pregnant!"</em> she announced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oh boy!" Tex replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex turned around to thank the strange man with the beard, but found he&rsquo;d somehow vanished without a trace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Still, Tex thought he could hear a familiar ho ho ho in the distance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Who the fuck was that?" Barton asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I think it was Krampus." answered Tex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Lame. Let's go."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex was about to ask where they were going when both of their phones buzzed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier; color: rgba(230, 126, 35, 1);"><strong>From Gamer Gril</strong><br />hey tex, you and barton are on the news</span></p>

<p>|</p>
<p>"Sean is not in the garbage band chat." Junji muttered.</p>
<p>"Yeah, and I don't remember writing him in, neither." Tex replied, just as confused.</p>
<p>"Judging by the keysmash, I think it's likely a simple typo."</p>
<p>Junji's answer didn't seem perfect, but Tex didn't end up thinking about it too hard.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton sent her address into the chat. Tex thought he was going to have to take the bus, but for the first time in her life, Barton offered to give him a ride without charging him. She claimed it was a Christmas present, but Tex knew that it was actually because she was in a good mood and secretly cared about him even though she never really acted like it even a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Traffic was bad, and the suburbs weren't too far away. It would've been faster if they'd run. Tex got the feeling that Junji and Tala both had chosen to do so, as they were waiting at the gate when Barton pulled up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex hopped out of the car while Barton dealt with the gate. He walked over to Tala and Junji to see they were watching the news on Tala's phone, where the mayor of Seattle was being interviewed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"...shooter by the name of Sam Hyde was taken down by another gun, and so we've decided not to go country wide with the ban after this incident.</em>" said the mayor. <em>"And with this knowledge, the Chinese government will no longer be going forth with their invasion.</em>"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"Fooey.</em>" Xi Jinping replied as he kicked at the dirt with his foot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex stopped watching the news when he noticed Junji was staring at him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Hmm?" asked Tex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I am impressed by your craftsmanship and quick hands." Junji said fondly. "I got you this to wear as a symbol of my gratitude."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">As he spoke, Junji held up a Santa outfit so skimpy that it was just a pair of red suspenders and tear-off pants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You're icky." Tex denied firmly, secretly into it.</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>"What is this?" Junji asked with disgust. "Do you want me to assault you?"</p>
<p>"I don't get what the big deal is."</p>
<p>"Ahh, what of it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"I got the scotch in my house." Barton announced. &ldquo;Who&rsquo;s ready to celebrate Jesus?&rdquo;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">They ended up drinking around the firepit in Barton's massive backyard. It was a little cold, but the fire was too nice for any of them to complain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We got our guns back, Dallas and me stopped a vague suicide bombing, and I'm almost buzzed." Barton said as she finished her third bottle of eighty proof scotch. "Guess everything worked out."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Well, not everything." Tala replied as she held up her stuffed Barney toy. "I still don't know what to do with this."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton looked at the Barney toy. Then she looked at the handgun on the table. She then looked back at Barney.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">They all had a few more drinks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;"><em>"No drill camp and no shined boots, in Dixie&rsquo;s armed militia.</em>&rdquo; Tex sang with Barton as he carried her on his shoulders. <em>&ldquo;All you need to do is shoot, in Dixie&rsquo;s armed militia.</em>&rdquo;</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Cause time grows short and funds are low. Cloud troops come and cloud troops go.</em> <em>But bless my soul the Newion knows we&rsquo;re Dixie&rsquo;s armed militia.</em>&rdquo; Tex muttered.</p>
<p>"Were you done?" Junji wondered.</p>
<p>|</p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Just a little higher, and I'll have the branch." Barton instructed. &ldquo;There, got it."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex tried to hold Barton as steady as he could while she tied the scarf around the tree branch. Once she was done, he carefully lowered her to the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">The other end of the scarf had been fastened around Barney's neck, suspending him about four feet from the ground.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"You wanna take the shot?" asked Barton.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"My pleasure." Tex replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">As Tex grabbed his gun and fitted it with the silencer, Barton pulled out her phone and positioned herself a foot to Barney's right, facing Tex.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Barton, I don't think you should stand down range." Tala said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Dallas is a good shot." Barton slurred in response.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Yeah, what's the worst that could happen?" Tex asked as he readied his weapon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton's phone made a noise when she hit the record button.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"We got Dallas, we got Barney." Barton narrated. "Barney's about to meet his maker."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Die you commie fuck--<em>whoa!"</em></span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex was cut off as a fat snowflake managed to hit him at an angle that his glasses couldn't block. Instinctively, his hand flicked to the right.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">There was a bang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex brought the tip of his gun down in immediate horror. He took a desperate glance around him to try and figure out where the bullet had gone, but didn't have to look very far to get his answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Oww." Barton said as she looked down at her chest.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex ran over to Barton as quick as he could and examined her with a face as white as a sheet. There was a hole in her shirt, just over her left breast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Barton lifted her shirt to reveal the tiniest red nick in the side of the hole she'd already had in her shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Tex breathed out a massive sigh of relief. He reached his arms out to wrap Barton inside them, but she denied the gesture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Don't make it weird." she scolded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Goddamn, what are the chances of that?" Tex wondered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Minuscule." Junji replied. "It's likely you're standing by her dead body right now in a substantial number of universes."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"Ahh!"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">Three trillion miles away, Jesus stood on a cloud and watched them all from above.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: courier;">"And there you have it, good citizens." said Jesus. "Guns can be useful for keeping the peace and protecting yourself from both foreign and local governments, but</span></p>
<p>|</p>
<p>&ldquo;It stops there.&rdquo; said Junji.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I got bored.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Junji let out a short chuckle.</p>
<p>"What'd you think?" Tex asked, his eyes filled with hope and wonder.</p>
<p>It took Junji a frighteningly long time to answer.</p>
<p>"It was--it could've been worse." he stammered.</p>
<p>Tex pouted into the carpet.</p>
<p>"The dialogue was well managed," Junji continued, "but you seem to have a very--minimalistic approach to imagery."</p>
<p>"What do I look like, an oil painting? If you wanna see stuff, go outside."</p>
<p>&ldquo;Why did you wait until the third act to introduce Krampus?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tex pouted harder. So much so that he got a taste of the carpet.</p>
<p>"And I cannot believe that gun safety was the mutuality you chose." Junji continued.</p>
<p>"What do you mean by that?"</p>
<p>"You wanted to come to a common ground between anti-gun and pro-gun activists, and the only thing you've given anti-gun activists is the importance of gun safety?"</p>
<p>&ldquo;Oh, what would&rsquo;ve you done? Talked about how we should sell all our guns to the black market along with plaster molds of our assholes?&rdquo;</p>
<p>"No. I would have spoken about non-lethal weaponry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Junji&rsquo;s response wasn&rsquo;t what Tex had been expecting.</p>
<p>"Yes, pepper spray and tasers often fail." Junji followed. "But perhaps they would not fail if we hadn&rsquo;t failed to invest in developing anything but lethal weapon after lethal weapon."</p>
<p>"Mmm..."</p>
<p>"What?"</p>
<p>"I'm just saying, if the government was hunting me down, I'd rather it be with a bullet. Don't even wanna know what they'd do to me if I was still alive."</p>
<p>There was a rustle as Junji set the papers down.</p>
<p>"Good news, in that case." he replied. "After today, you will never need to worry about the government catching you alive."</p>
<p>"That's a nice feeling."</p>
<p>As Tex gave the ground another affectionate squeeze, he felt the air shift next to him as Junji stood up from the couch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Well, this has been uncomfortably revealing.&rdquo; said Junji. "I am going to make some tea. Would you like some?"</p>
<p>"Mhm."</p>
<p>Tex heard Junji's feet leave for the kitchenette. After he'd rolled onto his back, Tex found the back pocket of the pants tangled around him and fished out his wallet.</p>
<p>It seemed a little too complicated to open, so Tex just pulled it into a hug.</p>
<p><em>"Mama.</em>" Tex muttered.</p>
